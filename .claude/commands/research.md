# üîç COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH WORKFLOW

## üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY ADVANCED TOOL USAGE

**You MUST use ALL available advanced tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire research process. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use advanced tools throughout the process.**

### üõ†Ô∏è ADVANCED TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS

**PRIORITIZE ADVANCED TOOLKIT OVER STANDARD TOOLS:**

- **Sequential-Thinking Tools**: MANDATORY START for every phase - use for systematic research planning, complex reasoning, and holistic approach
- **Context7 Tools**: Use for generic research and library documentation
- **OpenAI Documentation Tools**: Use for OpenAI-specific research with proper fallback workflow
- **Serena Tools**: Use for code analysis, symbol searches, and pattern matching when researching codebases
- **Standard Read/Write/Edit**: Use for file operations and project analysis when researching local projects, and as fallback when advanced tools don't support the specific action needed

**CONTINUOUS TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:**

- **MANDATORY**: Start EVERY phase with Sequential-Thinking for systematic approach
- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific research topic
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES as needed throughout the entire process
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- **PROACTIVELY** use advanced tools if a task requires it - don't wait for explicit instruction
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step
- **NEVER STOP** using advanced tools unless the action is only supported by Standard Tools

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### **Issue: All Tools Return "No Results"**

**Symptoms**: Every search tool returns empty results or "No results found"
**Solutions**:

- Try broader, more general search terms
- Use alternative terminology and synonyms
- Check if the topic is too specific or niche
- Use Context7 with very general terms as backup
- Consider if the research question needs to be rephrased

### **Issue: Conflicting Information from Different Sources**

**Symptoms**: Different tools provide contradictory information
**Solutions**:

- Prioritize official documentation over community sources
- Check publication dates and version information
- Look for consensus among multiple sources
- Note the discrepancies in your synthesis
- Use Sequential-Thinking to analyze the differences

### **Issue: Research Becomes Too Broad or Unfocused**

**Symptoms**: Finding too much information that doesn't directly answer the research question
**Solutions**:

- Refocus on the specific research question
- Use more targeted search terms
- Set stricter criteria for what information to include
- Use Sequential-Thinking to narrow the scope
- Stop researching and start synthesizing with what you have

### **Issue: Tools Keep Failing or Timing Out**

**Symptoms**: Tools return errors or time out repeatedly
**Solutions**:

- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Use simpler, shorter search queries
- Switch to alternative tools (e.g., Context7 instead of OpenAI tools)
- Use standard read/write tools for local file analysis
- Break down the research into smaller, more manageable pieces

### **Issue: Information Overload - Too Much to Synthesize**

**Symptoms**: Overwhelming amount of information that's hard to organize
**Solutions**:

- Use Sequential-Thinking to categorize information
- Focus on the most relevant and reliable sources
- Create a structured outline before synthesizing
- Prioritize information that directly answers the research question
- Consider doing multiple focused research sessions instead of one large one

### **Issue: Research Question is Too Vague or Ambiguous**

**Symptoms**: Not sure what to search for or how to proceed
**Solutions**:

- Use Sequential-Thinking to break down the question into specific components
- Start with very broad searches to understand the topic area
- Refine the research question based on initial findings
- Ask clarifying questions about what specific information is needed
- Focus on one aspect of the question at a time

### **Issue: Can't Find Recent or Up-to-Date Information**

**Symptoms**: All sources seem outdated or don't cover recent developments
**Solutions**:

- Use web search for the most recent information
- Check if the topic has changed significantly recently
- Look for official announcements or changelogs
- Use Context7 to find the most recent versions of libraries
- Note the age of information in your synthesis

**Remember**: If you encounter persistent issues, use Sequential-Thinking to analyze the problem and adjust your approach accordingly.
