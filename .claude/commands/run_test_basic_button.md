# Run Test Basic Button Slash Command

Execute Basic Tests AND Button Prompt Tests using AI Team orchestration with the @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator.

**Testing Focus:** Run BOTH Basic Tests AND Button Prompt Tests as defined in the official test specifications. NO custom test creation allowed.

## How to Use

1. **Ensure servers are running** (FastAPI backend + React frontend)
2. **Run this command**: `/run_test_basic_button`
3. **Follow the orchestrated plan** as specialists execute the Basic Tests AND Button Prompt Tests

## What This Command Does

When you invoke `/run_test_basic_button`, I will:

1. **Invoke @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator** to analyze the Basic Testing + Button Prompt Testing requirements and create a specialist assignment plan
2. **Execute the Combined Test Suite** using the exact agents recommended by the tech-lead
3. **Enforce official test specifications** reading from `gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md`
4. **Ensure MCP tool compliance** for all specialists
5. **Generate comprehensive test reports** and commit results WITHOUT attempting to fix any failures

## Command Execution

I'll use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze the Basic Testing + Button Prompt Testing requirements and assign the appropriate specialists from the available AI Team:

## Available Specialists (per CLAUDE.md)

| Task Category | Agent | Responsibilities | Notes |

## üö® CRITICAL: Test Specification Compliance

**SPECIALISTS CANNOT MAKE UP THEIR OWN TESTS**

When Basic Tests + Button Prompt Tests are requested, specialists MUST read the official test plan from:
`gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md`

**Combined Test Suite Definition**:

**Basic Tests**:
- **Market Status Tests**: System response to market status requests
- **Single Ticker Tests**: Individual ticker snapshot requests (NVDA, SPY, GME)  
- **Multi-Ticker Tests**: Combined multiple ticker requests

**Button Prompt Tests**:
- **Button Response Time Tests**: Analysis button response measurements (üìà Stock Snapshot, üéØ S&R, üîß Technical Analysis)
- **Button State Tests**: Processing state verification
- **Sequential Button Tests**: Multiple button click sequences
- **Empty Input Tests**: Button behavior with no input
- **Invalid Input Tests**: Button behavior with invalid tickers
- **Visual Feedback Tests**: Button visual state verification

**Failure to follow the official test plan invalidates all test results.**

## MCP Tool Requirements

**ALL specialist agents MUST use MCP tools:**

- `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` - For systematic analysis
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - For research
- `mcp__filesystem__*` - For efficient file operations
- `mcp__playwright__*` - For all browser testing operations

**Testing-specific MCP usage:**

- Testing agents MUST use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright__browser_click`, `mcp__playwright__browser_type`, etc.
- ALL browser operations must use MCP playwright tools
- File operations for test reports must use `mcp__filesystem__write_file`

**Failure to use required MCP tools will result in work rejection.**

## Execution Protocol - Basic + Button Testing A-I Workflow

The `/run_test_basic_button` command follows a systematic A-I process with tech-lead orchestration for combined Basic Tests + Button Prompt Tests execution.

### A-I Workflow Steps

**A. User Invokes `/run_test_basic_button`**

- User triggers combined test execution via `/run_test_basic_button` command
- Command scope: Execute BOTH Basic Tests AND Button Prompt Tests as defined in official test specifications

**B. Main Agent uses @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator (MANDATORY)**

- Tech-lead analyzes combined Basic + Button Testing requirements from official test specifications
- Systematic evaluation of server requirements and testing specialist assignment planning
- Must enforce reading `gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md`

**C. Server Verification Phase**

- Tech-lead assigns specialist to verify MANDATORY server startup requirements
- **FastAPI Backend**: Must show "Application startup complete." on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- **React Frontend**: Must show "VITE ready" on auto-selected port (3000‚Üí3003, etc.)
- **Health Checks**: Both servers must respond to health check requests
- **CORS Configuration**: Verify cross-origin requests work properly

**D. Combined Test Execution Phase**

- Specialist(s) execute BOTH Basic Tests AND Button Prompt Tests using MCP playwright tools
- **Single Browser Session**: ALL tests execute in SAME browser instance 
- **30-Second Polling**: Use polling methodology for accurate timeout detection
- **Performance Classification**: Record SUCCESS/SLOW_PERFORMANCE/TIMEOUT for each test
- **Coverage-First**: Continue ALL tests even if early tests fail

**E. Testing Methodology Enforcement**

- Specialist MUST follow official test specifications exactly
- **Basic Tests**: Use "PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity" for all test queries
- **Button Tests**: Use button-click methodology with specific UI element interactions (üìà/üéØ/üîß buttons)
- Accept ANY response format (JSON, emojis, conversational) - emojis are ENCOURAGED
- NO custom test creation - only execute Basic and Button tests as officially defined

**F. Test Report Generation - Final Task 1**

- Generate comprehensive Basic Tests + Button Prompt Tests execution report with performance data
- Include polling methodology results and performance classifications for all tests
- Document any failures with detailed analysis but DO NOT attempt to fix them
- Save report using `mcp__filesystem__write_file`

**G. Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update - Final Task 2**

- Generate comprehensive Basic + Button Tests Summary ‚Üí overwrite `LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md`
- Generate MAX 20-line high-level overview ‚Üí update CLAUDE.md task summary section
- Include all test results, performance data, and completion status for atomic commit

**H. Atomic Git Commit & Push - Final Task 3**

- PRIMARY: Use `git` for atomic operations
- Single atomic commit containing ALL changes:
  - Test report files
  - Documentation updates  
  - CLAUDE.md updates
  - LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md updates
- **CRITICAL**: Must push to complete workflow - commit without push is incomplete

**I. Final Verification - Final Task 4**

- Run final verification to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all test reports and changes are properly committed and pushed to GitHub

### üö® CRITICAL: Server Startup Requirements (MANDATORY)

**BOTH SERVERS MUST BE RUNNING BEFORE ANY TEST EXECUTION**:

1. **FastAPI Backend Server**:
```bash
cd gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

2. **React Frontend Server**:
```bash
cd gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/frontend_OpenAI
npm run dev
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO START SERVERS = AUTOMATIC TEST FAILURE**

### Combined Testing Principles Enforcement

- **Official Test Specifications ONLY**: No custom tests - follow Basic and Button tests exactly as documented
- **Single Browser Session**: ALL tests execute in SAME browser instance for real-world simulation
- **30-Second Polling**: Use polling methodology to distinguish slow performance from timeouts
- **Coverage-First**: Execute all tests regardless of individual failures
- **NO FIX ATTEMPTS**: Document failures but do not attempt to fix issues - testing only
- **Performance Classification**: Record accurate timing data and performance classifications for both Basic and Button tests

### Quality Requirements

- Tech-lead orchestrator MANDATORY for combined testing coordination
- MCP tools as PRIMARY method for all specialist testing operations
- Official test specifications compliance enforced
- Atomic commit principle: ALL changes in single commit operation
- Test report generation with polling data and performance insights for both test categories
