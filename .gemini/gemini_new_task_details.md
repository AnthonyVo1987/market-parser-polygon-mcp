# New Task Details

## Task Description

[OPENAI] Migrate Standalone OpenAI App to new Repo using Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow
- User has already created a local folder for the new repo and copied over the .env file with API keys to "~/Github/Stock_Sage_Agent"
- The new repo should be renamed to "Stock_Sage_Agent"
- We will migrate and setup JUST the Standalone OpenAI CLI & REACT Gui App from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp" folder
- We will not migrate the legacy CLI and Gradio Based UI
- End result is the new repo will just be the standalone gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp OpenAI CLI & REACT GUI
- Follow all steps up un



Task 2. USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING ALL MANDATED MCP TOOLS TO 

## Research Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s):

- USE ALL MANDATED MCP TOOLS to Read & Understand the Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow from OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

## Planning Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s):

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), USE SEQUENTIAL-THINKING AND ALL MANDATED MCP TOOLS generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s) to migrate using Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow from OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

## Implementation Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s):

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) - Use to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 3 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Perform comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, docs etc
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 3: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
