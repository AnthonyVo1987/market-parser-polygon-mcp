# New Task Details

## Task Description

[OpenAI] GEMINI: Research Docs for Playwrite MCP\CLI GUI Automated Testing Integration

- We need some research for the New application and not the legacy

- ## New Application (FastAPI + React)

This project is a comprehensive Python application with a CLI, FastAPI server, and React frontend for natural language financial queries using GPT-5 via the OpenAI Agents SDK and the Polygon.io MCP server.

- gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp
- This is a research and doc task ONLY - No code is needed

## Research Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

Task 1. Research & Analyze setting up & integrating Playwrite MCP Server Method into our development environment for you to perform the React GUI Testing

Task 2. Research & Analyze setting up & integrating Playwrite CLI method into our development environment for you to perform the React GUI Testing

Task 3. Based on the previous Research Tasks, research how to generate a comprehensive Guide .md doc with "GEMINI_xxx" file name prefix, saved to .gemini docs folder to Provide suggested recommendations of which method is best for our current environment that finds the best balance between automation vs ease of setup vs ease of use vs lower token usage. After that, a section to explain what Playwright is and it's capabilities. And then specific sections EACH for MCP AND CLI methods for the full the tutorial to setup, install, integration, & AND usage by you or any AI Coding agents whenever the user decides to pick one of the methods.  The new doc should be the single source of truth for user, You, or any AI Coding agent to setup, use, and test our REACT based GUI

## Planning Task(s) - use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) -  use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) -  use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

Final Task 3: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed
