# New Task Details

## Task Description

[OPENAI] Initial Repo Migrate Standalone OpenAI App to new Repo using Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow

- User has already created a local folder for the new repo and copied over the .env file with API keys to "~/Github/Stock_Sage_Agent"
- The new repo should be renamed to "Stock_Sage_Agent"
- We will migrate and setup JUST the Standalone OpenAI CLI & REACT Gui App from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp" folder
- We will not migrate the legacy CLI and Gradio Based UI
- End result is the new repo will just be the standalone gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp OpenAI CLI & REACT GUI

## Research Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- USE ALL MANDATED MCP TOOLS to Read & Understand the Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow from OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

## Planning Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), USE SEQUENTIAL-THINKING AND ALL MANDATED MCP TOOLS generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s) to migrate using Method 3: Hybrid GitHub MCP + Git Workflow from OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

## Implementation Task(s) - Use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist
- STOP AFTER new repo has been fully cloned to local user folder so user can review the new repo if it is ready or not
- There will be additional add-on task to perform more setup, installation, cli run\test, gui run\test, but for now, we will checkpoint after repo is pushed and cloned to perform the migration in phases
