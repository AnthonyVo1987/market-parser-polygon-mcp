# TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Lighthouse CI
# 
# This workflow is temporarily disabled during the prototyping phase.
# The project is still in early development and not ready for CI automation.
# 
# TO RE-ENABLE THIS WORKFLOW:
# 1. Change 'if: false' to 'if: true' in both jobs below
# 2. Or remove the 'if: false' conditions entirely
# 3. Commit and push the changes
# 
# The workflow will automatically run Lighthouse CI on:
# - Push to main/master/develop branches with frontend changes
# - Pull requests to main/master/develop branches with frontend changes
