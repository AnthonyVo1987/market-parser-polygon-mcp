# CLI Performance Analysis - January 9, 2025

## Critical Findings

### CLI vs FastAPI Architectural Inconsistency
- **FastAPI Server (OPTIMIZED)**: Uses shared instances (shared_mcp_server, shared_session), performance monitoring, proper resource lifecycle
- **CLI Implementation (NOT OPTIMIZED)**: Creates new MCP server per session, new Agent per query, no caching, no performance monitoring

### Key Performance Issues Identified
1. **Agent Creation Per Query**: CLI creates new Agent instance for every query (lines 1030-1036)
2. **MCP Server Creation Per Session**: CLI creates new server per session (line 1006)
3. **Unused Cache System**: Complete cache infrastructure exists but not used in CLI
4. **Missing Performance Monitoring**: CLI has no metrics or monitoring
5. **Synchronous Configuration Loading**: Still blocks startup (lines 100-110)

### Improvements Made Since Original Plan
- FastAPI server optimization with shared instances
- Performance monitoring with response timing middleware
- Direct prompt system implementation
- Better error handling and logging
- Code cleanup (removed unused functions)

### Optimization Strategy
**Phase 0 (CRITICAL)**: Align CLI architecture with FastAPI pattern
- Use shared MCP server and session
- Integrate existing cache system
- Add performance monitoring

**Expected Impact**: 60-80% performance improvement across all metrics

## Technical Details
- Cache system: TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=900) - exists but unused
- Ticker extraction: Still uses linear search through false positives
- Analysis intent detection: Still uses multiple string searches
- Session management: Still periodic cleanup only

## Next Steps
1. Implement CLI shared resource management
2. Integrate cache system into CLI
3. Add CLI performance monitoring
4. Continue with original optimization phases
