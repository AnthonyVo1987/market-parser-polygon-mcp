feat: complete backend modularization with 71% code reduction and full testing validation

- Refactor monolithic main.py (500+ lines → 144 lines) into modular architecture
- Extract Settings class to config.py for centralized configuration management
- Create dependencies.py for shared resource management and dependency injection
- Implement router modules: chat.py, health.py, system.py, models.py for API endpoints
- Add service layer: mcp_service.py, agent_service.py for business logic encapsulation
- Create utils modules: response_utils.py, datetime_utils.py for reusable functions
- Extract CLI functionality to cli.py for separation of concerns
- Fix frontend API endpoint routing (/chat → /api/v1/chat/) for proper communication
- Implement proper dependency injection pattern to eliminate circular imports
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout modular structure

Testing: CLI (7/7 tests passed), GUI (7/7 tests passed via Playwright)
Performance: No degradation, response times consistent (14-50s range)
Architecture: Clean separation of concerns, improved maintainability and scalability
