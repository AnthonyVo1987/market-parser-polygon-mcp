# Comprehensive Code Audit Findings - Market Parser Polygon MCP

## Executive Summary
The codebase has undergone significant refactoring with a "direct prompt migration" that removed the template system. This has left behind substantial dead code, unused functions, and redundant implementations.

## Major Dead Code Categories

### 1. Completely Dead Files
- `src/backend/prompt_templates.py` - Entire file is disabled/dead code
- `src/backend/utils/__init__.py` - Empty file

### 2. Dead Functions in main.py
- `validate_request_size()` - Never called
- `get_model_tpm_limit()` - Never called  
- `cleanup_session_periodically()` - Never called
- `print_guardrail_error()` - Only exported, never used in main.py

### 3. Dead Variables
- `active_requests` - Global variable defined but never used

### 4. Dead Classes/Models
- `FinanceOutput` - Only exported, never used in main.py
- `PromptTemplateInfo` - Never referenced
- `FollowUpQuestionsResponse` - Only exported, never used
- `TickerContextInfo` - Only used in one other model, never actually used

### 5. Monitoring Classes (Over-engineered)
- `MCPServerMonitor` - Complex class with methods never called
- `MCPServerResourceManager` - Complex class with methods never called  
- `PerformanceMonitor` - Complex class with methods never called

### 6. Removed Code Comments
- Multiple sections marked "Removed as part of direct prompt migration"
- GPT_4O and GPT_4O_MINI models removed
- Multiple API endpoints removed
- Template system completely removed

### 7. Empty Pass Statements
- 6+ pass statements where functionality was removed
- Empty exception handlers
- Disabled logging statements

## Duplicate Code Patterns

### 1. Agent Creation Logic
- Identical agent creation code in both CLI and GUI endpoints
- Same caching logic duplicated
- Same error handling duplicated

### 2. Token Extraction Logic
- Identical token extraction code in multiple places
- Same metadata handling duplicated

### 3. Configuration Loading
- Multiple configuration classes doing similar things
- Redundant settings management

## Unused Dependencies
- Many imports in main.py that are no longer used
- Frontend dependencies that may be unused
- Development dependencies that could be cleaned up

## Recommendations Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Cleanup)
1. Remove entire `prompt_templates.py` file
2. Remove unused functions: `validate_request_size`, `get_model_tpm_limit`, `cleanup_session_periodically`
3. Remove unused variables: `active_requests`
4. Remove unused classes: `FinanceOutput`, `PromptTemplateInfo`
5. Remove monitoring classes that are never used

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Refactoring)
1. Consolidate agent creation logic into shared function
2. Consolidate token extraction logic
3. Simplify configuration management
4. Remove empty pass statements and replace with proper error handling

### LOW PRIORITY (Optimization)
1. Clean up unused imports
2. Review frontend dependencies
3. Optimize package.json scripts
4. Remove development artifacts

## Estimated Impact
- **Lines of Code Reduction**: ~500-800 lines
- **File Reduction**: 2-3 files can be completely removed
- **Maintainability**: Significant improvement
- **Performance**: Minor improvement from reduced imports
- **Complexity**: Major reduction in unused complexity
