# Consolidated 3x Test Runs Analysis Completion

## Overview

Successfully completed comprehensive 3x test runs analysis for the Market Parser CLI using test_consolidated.sh script.

## Task Execution

- **Test Runs:** 3 complete runs of test_consolidated.sh
- **Tests per Run:** 7 standardized prompts each
- **Total Tests Executed:** 21 tests across all runs
- **Success Rate:** 100% (21/21 tests passed)
- **60s Target Compliance:** 85.7% (18/21 tests under 60s)

## Key Results by Run

- **Run 1:** 6/7 tests under 60s (85.7% compliance)
- **Run 2:** 5/7 tests under 60s (71.4% compliance)
- **Run 3:** 7/7 tests under 60s (100% compliance)

## Performance Analysis

- **Average Response Time:** 45.80s across all tests
- **Fastest Response:** 27.873s (GME closing price, Run 2)
- **Slowest Response:** 85.576s (SPY Technical Analysis, Run 2)
- **Most Consistent Test:** NVDA Support & Resistance (0.65s std dev)
- **Most Variable Test:** SPY Technical Analysis (24.25s std dev)

## Best Performing Tests

1. NVDA Support & Resistance Levels - 100% compliance, most consistent
