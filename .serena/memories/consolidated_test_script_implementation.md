# Consolidated Test Script Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a consolidated multi-test script (`test_consolidated.sh`) that runs all 7 standardized prompts and outputs results to a single file instead of multiple separate files.

## Key Features
- **Single Output File**: Consolidates all 7 test results into one comprehensive report
- **Complete CLI Output**: Captures full CLI responses for each test
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes response time, model, and token usage for each test
- **Proper Formatting**: Uses test headers, separators, and summary section
- **120s Timeout**: Per test with 5s delays between tests
- **Clean Directory Management**: Removes old results before each run

## Test Results Validation
- **All 7 tests passed**: 100% success rate
- **Response times under 60s**: All tests met performance target
- **Single file created**: Exactly 1 output file per run
- **Complete data capture**: Full CLI output with performance metrics
- **Proper verification**: Script validates correct file count

## Performance Insights
- **Fastest Response**: GME Closing Price Query (30.372s)
- **Average Response Time**: ~37.0s
- **Model Used**: gpt-5-nano (consistent across all tests)
- **All responses under 60s target**: Perfect performance

## File Structure
- **Script**: `test_consolidated.sh` (executable)
- **Output**: `test_results/consolidated_test_results_[timestamp].txt`
- **Size**: ~24KB comprehensive report
- **Format**: Test headers, CLI output, performance metrics, summary

## Usage
```bash
./test_consolidated.sh
```

This implementation provides a clean, efficient way to run comprehensive CLI testing with consolidated output for easy analysis and reporting.
