## Research Summary
Comprehensive research conducted using Context7 tools, OpenAI Cookbook documentation, and web search to inform the Dynamic Adaptive Prompting System implementation plan.

## Key Research Findings

### Dynamic Prompting Techniques
- **Template-Based Systems**: Modular prompt templates with variable substitution
- **User Instruction Parsing**: Regex-based pattern matching for user preferences
- **Preference Validation**: Whitelist approach with input sanitization
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when customization fails

### Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: Multi-layer validation with pattern matching
- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Instruction isolation and context separation
- **Sanitization**: Character filtering and content validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: LRU cache for frequently used prompt configurations
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand loading of prompt components
- **Template Optimization**: Efficient template variable substitution
- **Memory Management**: Bounded cache with automatic eviction

### User Experience Design
- **Instruction Patterns**: Intuitive bracket-based instruction format
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and suggestions
- **Fallback Behavior**: Seamless fallback to default prompts
- **Customization Options**: Comprehensive but controlled customization

## Implementation Insights
