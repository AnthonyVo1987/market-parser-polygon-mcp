# Dynamic Prompting System Security Architecture

## Security Overview
The Dynamic Adaptive Prompting System implements comprehensive security measures across multiple layers to ensure safe and reliable operation.

## Security Components

### 1. SecurityManager (`security_features.py`)
**Purpose**: Central coordination of all security features
**Key Features**:
- Unified security validation interface
- Comprehensive request validation pipeline
- Security status monitoring and reporting
- Admin functions for security management

**Validation Pipeline**:
1. IP whitelist verification
2. Rate limiting enforcement
3. Input validation and threat detection
4. Audit logging of all interactions

### 2. RateLimiter
**Algorithm**: Sliding window with configurable rules
**Features**:
- Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
- Configurable time windows and block durations
- Automatic user unblocking after timeout
- Multiple rate limiting rules (default, high_frequency, critical)

**Configuration**:
```python
rate_limit_rules = {
    'default': RateLimitRule(100, 3600, 300, SecurityLevel.MEDIUM),
    'high_frequency': RateLimitRule(10, 60, 60, SecurityLevel.HIGH),
    'critical': RateLimitRule(5, 300, 900, SecurityLevel.CRITICAL)
}
```

### 3. EnhancedInputValidator
**Multi-layer Validation**:
- Input length validation (max 5000 characters)
- Blocked pattern detection (scripts, injections)
- Suspicious keyword analysis
- Encoding attack detection
- Path traversal prevention

**Blocked Patterns**:
- Script tags: `<script[^>]*>.*?</script>`
- JavaScript protocols: `javascript:`
- Event handlers: `onload=`, `onerror=`
- System commands: `eval()`, `exec()`, `system()`
- File access: `file://`, `../`, `/etc/passwd`

**Threat Levels**:
- LOW: Minor violations, warnings only
- MEDIUM: Suspicious patterns, increased monitoring
- HIGH: Potential attacks, blocked with logging
- CRITICAL: Definite attacks, immediate blocking

### 4. AuditLogger
**Comprehensive Logging**:
- All security events with timestamps
- User interactions and response times
- Security violations and blocking actions
- System performance metrics

**Log Levels**:
- INFO: Normal operations and user interactions
- WARNING: Medium-severity security events
- ERROR: High and critical security events

**Event Types**:
- INJECTION: SQL/code injection attempts
- RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Rate limiting violations
- MALICIOUS_INPUT: Dangerous input patterns
- UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS: Access control violations
- SUSPICIOUS_PATTERN: Unusual behavior patterns

### 5. CircuitBreaker
**System Resilience**:
- Prevents cascading failures
- Configurable failure thresholds
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

**Configuration**:
- Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
- Recovery timeout: 60 seconds
- Automatic state transitions

### 6. IPWhitelist
**Access Control**:
- IP range-based access control
- CIDR notation support
- Default allow-all configuration
- Configurable IP ranges

## Security Configuration

### SecurityConfig Class
```python
@dataclass
class SecurityConfig:
    enable_rate_limiting: bool = True
    enable_input_validation: bool = True
    enable_audit_logging: bool = True
    enable_circuit_breaker: bool = True
    max_input_length: int = 10000
    blocked_patterns: List[str] = None
    allowed_ip_ranges: List[str] = None
    rate_limit_rules: Dict[str, RateLimitRule] = None
```

### Default Security Settings
- Rate limiting: Enabled with multiple tiers
- Input validation: Comprehensive pattern matching
- Audit logging: All events logged to file
- Circuit breaker: 5 failure threshold, 60s recovery
- Max input length: 5000 characters (configurable)
- IP whitelist: Allow all by default (0.0.0.0/0)

## Security Event Handling

### Event Classification
1. **Security Events**: Tracked with SecurityEvent dataclass
2. **User Interactions**: Normal operations logging
3. **Performance Metrics**: System health monitoring
4. **Admin Actions**: Administrative operations audit

### Response Actions
- **Block**: Immediate request rejection
- **Log**: Event recording for analysis
- **Alert**: High-priority notifications
- **Monitor**: Increased surveillance

## Integration with Dynamic Prompting

### SecureDynamicPromptManager
**Security-First Design**:
- All requests validated before processing
- Input sanitization before prompt generation
- Comprehensive error handling with security logging
- Performance monitoring with security metrics

**Request Flow**:
1. IP whitelist validation
2. Rate limiting check
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Circuit breaker protection
5. Prompt generation with monitoring
6. Audit logging of results

### Security Response Format
```python
{
    'success': bool,
    'prompt': str,
    'security_info': {
        'validated': bool,
        'sanitized': bool,
        'threats_detected': List[str],
        'rate_limited': bool
    },
    'errors': List[str],
    'metadata': {
        'user_id': str,
        'ip_address': str,
        'timestamp': float,
        'processing_time': float
    }
}
```
