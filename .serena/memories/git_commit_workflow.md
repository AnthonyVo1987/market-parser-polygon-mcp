# Git Commit Workflow - MANDATORY PROCESS

## üî¥ CRITICAL RULE: Stage ONLY Immediately Before Commit

**NEVER stage files early during development. Staging is the LAST step before committing.**

## The Problem with Early Staging

**What happens when you stage too early:**

1. ‚è∞ **Time T1**: You stage files with `git add`
   - Staging area = snapshot at T1
2. ‚è∞ **Time T2-T5**: You continue working
   - Update config files
   - Run tests (generates test reports)
   - Update documentation
   - Modify settings
3. ‚è∞ **Time T6**: You commit with `git commit`
   - **Only commits the T1 snapshot**
   - **All work after T1 is MISSING**

**Result: Incomplete, broken atomic commits**

## Correct Atomic Commit Workflow

### Phase 1: DO ALL THE WORK FIRST

```bash
# Make ALL code changes
# Run ALL tests
# Update ALL documentation
# Modify ALL config files
# Generate ALL test reports

# ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT RUN git add YET
```

### Phase 2: VERIFY EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE

```bash
# Check what files changed
git status

# Review all changes
git diff

# Ensure:
‚úÖ All code changes complete
‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ All docs updated
‚úÖ All config files modified
‚úÖ All test reports generated
```

### Phase 3: STAGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE

```bash
# Stage ALL related files in ONE command
git add -A

# OR stage specific files if you're certain:
git add file1.py file2.ts test-report.txt config.json docs.md

# ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the FIRST time you should run git add
```

### Phase 4: VERIFY STAGING IMMEDIATELY

```bash
# Check staging area
git status

# Should show:
# - Changes to be committed: [ALL your files]
# - Changes not staged for commit: [NONE related to your task]
# - Untracked files: [NONE related to your task]

# If anything is unstaged/untracked that should be included:
git add [missing-file]
```

### Phase 5: COMMIT IMMEDIATELY

```bash
# Create commit RIGHT AFTER staging
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[TAG] Descriptive commit message

- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

)"

# ‚ö†Ô∏è NO DELAY between git add and git commit
```

### Phase 6: PUSH IMMEDIATELY

```bash
# Push right after commit
git push

# Verify push succeeded
```

## Timeline: Correct vs Incorrect

### ‚ùå INCORRECT (Early Staging)

```
09:00 - Edit backend files ‚Üí git add backend/
09:15 - Edit frontend files ‚Üí git add frontend/
09:30 - Update docs ‚Üí git add docs/
09:45 - Run tests (generates test-reports/) ‚Üê NOT staged
10:00 - Update .claude/settings.local.json ‚Üê NOT staged
10:15 - git commit ‚Üê INCOMPLETE! Missing test reports + settings
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT (Stage at End)

```
09:00 - Edit backend files
09:15 - Edit frontend files
09:30 - Update docs
09:45 - Run tests (generates test-reports/)
10:00 - Update .claude/settings.local.json
10:15 - git status (verify all changes)
10:16 - git add -A ‚Üê Stage EVERYTHING
10:17 - git status (verify staging)
10:18 - git commit ‚Üê COMPLETE! All files included
10:19 - git push
```

## What Belongs in an Atomic Commit

**A single atomic commit should include:**

1. ‚úÖ **Code changes** (backend + frontend)
2. ‚úÖ **Test files** (if modified)
3. ‚úÖ **Test reports** (evidence of passing tests)
4. ‚úÖ **Documentation updates** (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
5. ‚úÖ **Memory updates** (.serena/memories/)
6. ‚úÖ **Config changes** (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
7. ‚úÖ **Task plan updates** (TODO_task_plan.md, etc.)

**All of these should be staged together, at the END, in ONE `git add` command.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Staging as You Go

```bash
‚ùå git add backend/api.py
‚ùå [continue working...]
‚ùå git add frontend/component.tsx
‚ùå [continue working...]
‚ùå git add docs/README.md
‚ùå [run tests - generates reports]
‚ùå git commit  # ‚Üê Missing test reports!
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Test Evidence

```bash
‚ùå git add src/
‚ùå git add docs/
‚ùå git commit  # ‚Üê Where are the test reports?
```

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Config Changes

```bash
‚ùå git add src/ docs/ test-reports/
‚ùå git commit  # ‚Üê Missing .claude/settings.local.json!
```

## Verification Checklist Before Commit

**Before running `git commit`, verify:**

- [ ] All code changes complete and working
- [ ] All tests passing (27/27 PASS for this project)
- [ ] Test reports generated and reviewed
- [ ] All documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, tech_stack.md, etc.)
- [ ] All config files modified (if needed)
- [ ] All Serena memories updated (if needed)
- [ ] `git status` shows ALL files staged
- [ ] `git status` shows NOTHING unstaged that should be included
- [ ] No more than 60 seconds between `git add` and `git commit`

## Recovery from Early Staging

**If you already staged files too early:**

```bash
# Option 1: Unstage everything and start over
git reset HEAD

# Do remaining work
[finish all tasks...]

# Stage everything at once
git add -A

# Commit immediately
git commit -m "..."
```

```bash
# Option 2: Add missing files before committing
git status  # See what's unstaged

git add [missing-file-1]
git add [missing-file-2]

# Verify everything is staged
git status

# Commit immediately
git commit -m "..."
```

## Why This Matters

**Atomic commits are the foundation of:**

1. **Reproducible builds** - Anyone can checkout the commit and it works
2. **Clean history** - Each commit is a complete, working unit
3. **Easy rollbacks** - Can revert entire feature, not partial changes
4. **Code review** - Reviewers see ALL related changes together
5. **CI/CD** - Build systems expect complete, working commits

**Incomplete commits break all of these.**

## Enforcement

**In this project, atomic commits are MANDATORY:**

- üî¥ Commits missing test evidence will be reverted
- üî¥ Commits missing documentation will be reverted
- üî¥ Commits with partial changes will be reverted
- ‚úÖ Only complete atomic commits are acceptable

## Summary

1. **DO ALL WORK FIRST** (code, tests, docs, config)
2. **VERIFY COMPLETION** (git status, review changes)
3. **STAGE EVERYTHING** (git add -A)
4. **VERIFY STAGING** (git status again)
5. **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY** (git commit)
6. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY** (git push)

**Remember: `git add` is the LAST step before `git commit`, not a step during development.**
