# Project Environment Setup Guide Creation - September 29, 2025

## Overview
Created a comprehensive Project Environment Setup Guide for AI agents to handle environment corruption scenarios. This guide is based on the successful re-initialization performed on September 29, 2025, and incorporates best practices for Python and Node.js environment management.

## Guide Location
- **File**: `docs/PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Size**: 10,225 bytes
- **Created**: September 29, 2025

## Guide Contents

### 1. Success Criteria
- All 7/7 comprehensive CLI tests pass
- Python environment with 119 packages installed
- Node.js environment with 1131 packages installed
- Frontend builds successfully
- Backend server starts without errors
- All imports and dependencies working correctly

### 2. Six-Phase Recovery Procedure
1. **Pre-Reset Verification**: Check current status and identify corruption symptoms
2. **Complete Environment Cleanup**: Remove all environment files and processes
3. **Python Environment Setup**: Install Python dependencies with uv
4. **Node.js Environment Setup**: Install Node.js dependencies with npm
5. **Environment Validation**: Test backend and frontend servers
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run 7-prompt test suite for final validation

### 3. Troubleshooting Section
- Python Import Errors (ModuleNotFoundError)
- Node.js Peer Dependency Conflicts
- Port Already in Use Issues
- Virtual Environment Path Issues

### 4. Success Validation Checklist
- 10-point checklist to verify complete recovery
- Quick recovery commands for rapid restoration
- Notes specifically for AI agents

## Key Commands Documented

### Environment Cleanup
```bash
rm -rf .venv node_modules package-lock.json uv.lock dist/ dev-dist/
```

### Python Setup
```bash
uv sync
uv run python -c "import openai; from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession; print('âœ… Python imports working')"
```

### Node.js Setup
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```

### Validation
```bash
./test_7_prompts_comprehensive.sh
```
