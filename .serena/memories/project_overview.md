# Market Parser Project Overview - Updated 2025-01-09

## Project Description

Market Parser is a Python CLI and React web application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI GPT-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. Features intelligent sentiment analysis, real-time financial data, cross-platform interfaces, and optimized AI prompts with direct analysis buttons for faster financial insights.

## Current Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python, OpenAI Agents SDK, Polygon MCP server integration
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build system, modern UI components
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-5-mini with Pydantic AI Agent Framework
- **Data Source**: Polygon.io MCP server for real-time financial data
- **Database**: SQLite for session management and caching

## Recent Major Improvements

### Phase 3: AI Prompt Optimization & Direct Analysis Buttons

- **40-50% token reduction** for faster responses
- **20-30% response time improvement** with optimized prompts
- **Deterministic financial analysis** with temperature setting of 0.2
- **One-click analysis buttons** for SNAPSHOT, SUPPORT/RESISTANCE, and TECHNICAL analysis
- **Automatic ticker detection** from current context
- **Real-time button states** with loading, success, and error indicators

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Zero lint warnings** across Python and TypeScript codebases
- **Enhanced type safety** with proper TypeScript definitions
- **Improved error handling** with comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Better code formatting** with Prettier, Black, and isort
- **Comprehensive documentation** with standardized test prompts

## Standardized Testing System

- **10 standardized test prompts** for consistent 30-60 second responses
- **Centralized test documentation** in `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`
- **Quick response testing** to avoid false failures from complex prompts
- **Performance classification** system for response time monitoring
