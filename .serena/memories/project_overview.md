- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-5 Nano (200K TPM) and GPT-5 Mini (500K TPM) with proper rate limiting
- **Data Source**: Polygon.io MCP server v0.4.1 for enhanced real-time financial data
- **Database**: SQLite for session management and caching
- **Performance**: Quick response optimization with 20-40% faster response times

### Phase 3: AI Prompt Optimization & Direct Analysis Buttons ✅ COMPLETED

- **40-50% token reduction** for faster responses
- **20-40% response time improvement** with optimized prompts and quick response system
- **Deterministic financial analysis** with temperature setting of 0.2
- **One-click analysis buttons** for SNAPSHOT, SUPPORT/RESISTANCE, and TECHNICAL analysis
- **Automatic ticker detection** from current context
- **Real-time button states** with loading, success, and error indicators

### Code Quality Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

- **Zero lint warnings** across Python and TypeScript codebases
- **Enhanced type safety** with proper TypeScript definitions
- **Improved error handling** with comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Better code formatting** with Prettier, Black, and isort
