# Serena Tools Quick Check Results

## Status: ✅ MOSTLY WORKING

### Working Tools:
- **list_dir**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **find_file**: ✅ Working perfectly  
- **search_for_pattern**: ✅ Working perfectly (found many function definitions)
- **write_memory**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **read_memory**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **list_memories**: ✅ Working perfectly

### Not Working:
- **find_symbol**: ❌ Still not finding Python symbols (LSP server issue)
- **insert_after_symbol**: ❌ Depends on find_symbol
- **insert_before_symbol**: ❌ Depends on find_symbol  
- **replace_symbol_body**: ❌ Depends on find_symbol

## Key Finding:
The pattern search found many Python function definitions (like `def print_response`), but the symbol discovery tool cannot find them. This confirms the Python LSP server issue.

## Recommendation:
Need to fix Python LSP server configuration to enable symbol discovery for Python files.
