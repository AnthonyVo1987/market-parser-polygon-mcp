# Standardized Test Prompts System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Standardized Test Prompts System has been successfully implemented to ensure consistent, reliable testing across all Market Parser scenarios. This system prevents false failures from complex prompts and guarantees 30-60 second response times.

## üìã CORE COMPONENTS

### Single Source of Truth
- **File**: `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive reference for all standardized test prompts
- **Content**: 10 test prompts, usage guidelines, performance classification, integration notes

### 10 Standardized Test Prompts

1. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: What is the current Market Status?"**
2. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"**
3. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Full Market Snapshot: SPY, QQQ, IWM"**
4. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, what was the closing price of GME today?"**
5. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, how is SOUN performance doing this week?"**
6. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Top Market Movers Today for Gainers"**
7. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Top Market Movers Today for Losers"**
8. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Support & Resistance Levels NVDA"**
9. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Technical Analysis SPY"**

## üé® PERFORMANCE CLASSIFICATION

### Response Time Categories
- **SUCCESS** (‚úÖ): Response received in under 45 seconds
- **SLOW_PERFORMANCE** (‚ö†Ô∏è): Response received between 45 and 120 seconds (requires optimization)
- **TIMEOUT** (‚ùå): No response received within 120 seconds (critical failure)

### Expected Performance
- **Target Response Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Consistency**: All prompts designed for similar processing requirements
- **Reliability**: Prevents false failures from complex or random queries

## üìö DOCUMENTATION INTEGRATION

### Dual Documentation Approach
1. **Individual Prompts**: Listed in all relevant documentation files
2. **Comprehensive Reference**: Link to `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`

### Files Updated
- **Main Documentation**: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md
- **Test Documentation**: 
  - tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md
  - tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md
  - tests/playwright/UI_complete_test_execution_guide.md

### Integration Notes for AI Agents
- **Reference this document**: AI Agents should refer to `test_prompts.md` as primary source
- **Copy verbatim**: When executing tests, copy prompts exactly as written
- **Avoid variations**: Do not introduce variations or additional context
- **Focus on single intent**: Each prompt tests specific analysis intent with minimal complexity
- **Report performance**: Always report response time and classify according to performance criteria

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Backend Fixes Applied
- **Import Error Handling**: Fixed in src/backend/main.py and src/backend/api_models.py
- **Robust Import System**: Both relative and absolute imports now work correctly
- **Code Quality**: All linting issues resolved

### Documentation Standards
- **Consistent Formatting**: All files follow same prompt structure
- **Clear References**: Easy navigation between individual prompts and comprehensive docs
- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth ensures easy updates

## ‚úÖ BENEFITS ACHIEVED

### Testing Consistency
- **Predictable Results**: All tests use same prompt structure
- **Reliable Performance**: Consistent 30-60 second response times
- **False Failure Prevention**: Eliminates issues from complex or random prompts

### Development Efficiency
- **Quick Reference**: Individual prompts available in all docs
- **Comprehensive Guide**: Detailed reference in test_prompts.md
- **Easy Maintenance**: Single source of truth for updates

### Quality Assurance
- **Standardized Testing**: All scenarios use proven prompts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Clear classification system for response times
- **Documentation Coverage**: Complete integration across all relevant files

## üöÄ USAGE GUIDELINES

### For AI Agents
1. **Use Only These Prompts**: Copy prompts exactly as written
2. **Include Prefix**: Always include "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls:" prefix
3. **Report Performance**: Classify response time according to performance criteria
4. **Reference Documentation**: Use test_prompts.md for comprehensive guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Test Consistency**: Use these prompts for all testing scenarios
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and classify results
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update test_prompts.md for any changes
4. **Maintenance**: Keep individual prompt lists in sync with main reference
