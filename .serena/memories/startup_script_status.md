# Startup Script Status Update

## Current Status (September 27, 2025)

### ✅ WORKING: start-app-xterm.sh
- **Status**: Fully functional and tested
- **Test Results**: 5/5 successful tests with Playwright validation
- **Usage**: This is now the PRIMARY and RECOMMENDED startup script
- **Features**: 
  - Properly exits after starting servers
  - Allows "Auto-Ran command" pattern
  - Works with sleep 15 + Playwright testing
  - Uses xterm with proper window positioning and fonts

### ❌ BROKEN: start-app.sh  
- **Status**: Non-functional due to blocking issues
- **Problem**: Script gets stuck and prevents "Auto-Ran command" pattern
- **Issue**: Cannot proceed to sleep 15 or Playwright testing
- **Action**: Keep script file but remove from all documentation
- **Note**: To be fixed later, use start-app-xterm.sh instead

## Documentation Updates Required
- Update START_SCRIPT_README.md to prioritize start-app-xterm.sh
- Remove all references to start-app.sh from docs
- Update any other documentation that mentions startup scripts
- Add note about start-app.sh being temporarily broken
