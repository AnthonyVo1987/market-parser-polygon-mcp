## üéØ Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start development**: `./start-app.sh`
2. **Make changes** to code
3. **Run linting**: `npm run lint:fix`
4. **Test changes**: Use standardized test prompts
5. **Commit changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "message"`

### Code Quality Workflow

1. **Before committing**: `npm run check:all`
2. **Fix issues**: `npm run lint:fix`
3. **Verify types**: `npm run type-check`
4. **Test performance**: `npm run test:perf:dev`

### Testing Workflow

1. **Use standardized prompts** for consistent testing
2. **Test all environments**: dev, staging, production
3. **Monitor performance** with Lighthouse CI
4. **Verify PWA functionality** on different devices
