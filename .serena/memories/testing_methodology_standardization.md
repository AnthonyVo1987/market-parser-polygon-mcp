# Testing Methodology Standardization - Market Parser Polygon MCP

## Standardized Testing Framework
Established comprehensive testing methodology for Market Parser Polygon MCP application with standardized prompts and performance benchmarks.

## Test Prompt Standardization
**Source:** `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all standardized test prompts
**Target Response Time:** 20-45 seconds (GPT-5 optimization)

### 7 Standardized Test Prompts
1. **Market Status Query:** "What the current Market Status, Date, & Time: Open, Closed, After-Hours, Pre-market, Overnight?"
2. **Single Stock Snapshot:** "Single Stock Snapshot Price NVDA"
3. **Full Market Snapshot:** "Full Market Snapshot Price: SPY, QQQ, IWM"
4. **Closing Price Query:** "GME closing price today"
5. **Performance Analysis:** "SOUN Price performance this week"
6. **Support & Resistance:** "NVDA Price Support & Resistance Levels"
7. **Technical Analysis:** "SPY Price Technical Analysis"

## Performance Classification System
- **SUCCESS:** < 30 seconds (excellent performance)
- **GOOD:** 30-45 seconds (good performance, within expected range)
- **SLOW_PERFORMANCE:** 45-90 seconds (acceptable but investigate optimization)
- **TIMEOUT:** > 90 seconds (failure - investigate configuration)

## Testing Environments
### CLI Testing
- **Command:** `uv run src/backend/main.py`
- **Script:** `test_7_prompts_comprehensive.sh`
- **Expected Performance:** 20-45 seconds average
- **Actual Performance:** 30.123s average (GOOD rating)

### GUI Testing
- **Framework:** Playwright Browser Automation
- **Environment:** http://127.0.0.1:3000
- **Expected Performance:** 20-45 seconds average
- **Actual Performance:** 51.15s average (SLOW_PERFORMANCE rating)

## Test Execution Methodology
### CLI Testing Process
1. Sequential execution of 7 standardized prompts
2. 90-second timeout per test
3. Response time capture using timestamp comparison
4. Success indicator validation
5. Comprehensive analysis and reporting

### GUI Testing Process
1. Playwright browser automation
2. Sequential test execution mimicking user experience
3. Screenshot capture for each response
4. Visible text extraction for validation
5. Performance measurement and analysis

## Test Coverage Analysis
### Query Types Validated
- ✅ Market Status Queries - Market hours, session status
- ✅ Single Stock Queries - Individual stock prices
- ✅ Multi-Stock Queries - ETF and index snapshots
- ✅ Historical Data - Closing prices
- ✅ Performance Analysis - Weekly performance with percentages
- ✅ Technical Analysis - Support/resistance levels
- ✅ Advanced Technical - VWAP, volume, trend analysis

### Data Quality Validation
- **Accuracy:** All responses contain accurate, current market data
- **Completeness:** Responses include all requested information
- **Formatting:** Consistent, readable output format
- **Context:** Appropriate market context provided

## Performance Benchmarking
### CLI vs GUI Comparison
| Metric | CLI Testing | GUI Testing | Difference |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Average Response Time | 30.123s | 51.15s | +21.03s |
| Min Response Time | 11.984s | 45.74s | +33.76s |
| Max Response Time | 42.524s | 58.35s | +15.83s |
| Performance Rating | GOOD | SLOW_PERFORMANCE | -1 Level |
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% | Same |

### Performance Trends Identified
1. **Simple Queries** (Market Status, Single Stock): 45-50s
2. **Multi-Stock Queries** (Full Market Snapshot): 50-55s
3. **Complex Analysis** (Technical Analysis, Support/Resistance): 50-60s
