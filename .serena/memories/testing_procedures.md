# Testing Procedures and Validation

## üî¥ CRITICAL: TWO-PHASE TESTING APPROACH (Updated Oct 12, 2025)

### Overview

**The test script can ONLY verify that responses were received. It CANNOT validate response correctness, tool calls, or data accuracy.**

All testing MUST follow the two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Automated Response Generation

**What the Script Does:**
- Runs all 39 test prompts sequentially in ONE CLI session
- Measures response times
- Reports "X/39 COMPLETED" (responses received)
- Generates test report with full output

**What the Script Does NOT Do:**
- ‚ùå Validate response correctness
- ‚ùå Check tool calls
- ‚ùå Verify data accuracy
- ‚ùå Detect hallucinations
- ‚ùå Confirm proper formatting

**Script Limitation:** "39/39 COMPLETED" means "39 responses received" NOT "39 tests passed validation"

### Phase 2: Manual Response Verification (MANDATORY)

**AI Agent MUST verify each of the 39 responses against these criteria:**

1. ‚úÖ **Response Addresses Prompt**: Response directly answers the question asked
2. ‚úÖ **Correct Ticker Symbols**: Proper tickers used ($SPY, $NVDA, $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN)
3. ‚úÖ **Proper Tool Calls**: Polygon, Finnhub, or Tradier tools called appropriately
4. ‚úÖ **Data Formatting**: OHLC data, tables, options chains formatted correctly
5. ‚úÖ **No Hallucinations**: All data appears legitimate, no made-up numbers or dates
6. ‚úÖ **Options Bid/Ask**: Options chains show Bid and Ask columns (NOT midpoint/average)
7. ‚úÖ **TA Indicators**: Technical analysis includes proper metrics when requested
8. ‚úÖ **Completeness**: Response not truncated, no unexpected errors

**Mandatory Checkpoint Question:**
"Did you verify the results of EACH test prompt to ensure the response was correct with proper tool calls and formatting?"

- **If NO**: You have NOT completed testing. Return to Phase 2.
- **If YES**: Testing is complete, proceed to documentation updates.

### Workflow Summary

```
1. Code Implementation ‚úÖ
2. Test Suite Update ‚úÖ
3. Phase 1: Execute test_cli_regression.sh ‚úÖ
4. Phase 1 Results: 39/39 COMPLETED ‚úÖ
5. Phase 2: Manually verify ALL 39 responses ‚úÖ (MANDATORY)
6. Checkpoint: "Did you verify each response?" YES ‚úÖ
7. Documentation Updates ‚úÖ
8. Atomic Commit ‚úÖ
```

**CRITICAL:** Skipping Phase 2 = Testing INCOMPLETE = Task INVALID

## Primary Test Script

### CLI Regression Test Suite (RECOMMENDED)
**Script:** `test_cli_regression.sh`

**Purpose:** Tests all 39 standardized prompts (Updated Oct 12, 2025) in a SINGLE CLI session with two-phase validation.

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ All 39 tests run sequentially in ONE session
- ‚úÖ Accurate response time tracking with awk-based calculations
- ‚úÖ Session persistence validation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test reports with formatted output
- ‚úÖ Performance classification
- ‚úÖ Configurable loop count (1-10 runs)
- ‚úÖ 2 decimal precision for all statistics
- ‚úÖ Human-readable duration format (MM min SS sec)
- ‚úÖ Two-phase validation workflow with Phase 2 instructions

**Usage:**
```bash
# Single test loop (39 tests) - Phase 1 only
chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh

# Multiple test loops (e.g., 3 loops for validation)
chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh 3
```

**Test Coverage (39 tests total - Updated Oct 12, 2025):**

1. **SPY Test Sequence (Tests 1-16 - 16 tests)**:
   - Market Status
   - Current Price OHLC: $SPY
   - Yesterday's Price OHLC: $SPY
   - Last week's Performance OHLC: $SPY
   - Stock Price on previous week's Friday OHLC: $SPY
   - Stock Price Performance last 5 Trading Days OHLC: $SPY
   - Stock Price Performance past 2 Weeks OHLC: $SPY
   - Stock Price Performance past month: $SPY
   - Stock Price Performance past 3 months: $SPY
   - Get technical analysis indicator DATA only with NO ANALYSIS: $SPY
   - Support & Resistance Levels: $SPY
   - Perform technical analysis (Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Signals): $SPY
   - Get options expiration dates: $SPY
   - Get Call Options Chain Expiring this Friday: $SPY
   - Get Put Options Chain Expiring this Friday: $SPY
   - Analyze Options Chain Data & provide Call/Put Wall Strike Prices: $SPY

2. **NVDA Test Sequence (Tests 17-31 - 15 tests)**:
   - Current Price OHLC through Options Wall Analysis (no Market Status)
   - Same pattern as SPY but without initial Market Status prompt
   - All OHLC queries, TA, options expiration, options chains, wall analysis

3. **Multi-Ticker Test Sequence (Tests 32-39 - 8 tests)**:
   - Current Price OHLC: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Yesterday's Price OHLC: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Yesterday's Closing Price: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Last week's Performance OHLC: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Get TA indicator DATA only: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Support & Resistance Levels: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Perform TA (Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Signals): $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN
   - Get options expiration dates: $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN

**Note:** Multi-ticker sequence now uses $SOUN instead of $GME (Oct 12, 2025)

**Expected Performance (Oct 12, 2025 - 39 Test Suite):**
- **Total Tests**: 39 per loop
- **Average Response Time**: ~10-12s (EXCELLENT)
- **Phase 1 Duration**: ~7-8 minutes per loop
- **Phase 2 Duration**: ~60-90 minutes (manual verification)
- **Total Testing Time**: ~70-100 minutes per full validation cycle

**Performance Classification:**

| Category | Time Range | Rating |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| EXCELLENT | < 30s | ‚úÖ Expected for most queries |
| GOOD | 30-45s | ‚úÖ Acceptable for complex queries |
| ACCEPTABLE | 45-90s | ‚ö†Ô∏è May need optimization |
| SLOW | > 90s | ‚ùå Needs investigation |

## Test Script Output Changes (Oct 12, 2025)

### Old Terminology (Before Oct 12, 2025):
- ‚ùå "PASS/FAIL" - Misleading, suggested validation
- ‚ùå "100% pass rate" - False confidence
- ‚ùå "Tests passed" - Incorrect assumption

### New Terminology (After Oct 12, 2025):
- ‚úÖ "COMPLETED/INCOMPLETE" - Neutral, factual
- ‚úÖ "Generation rate" - Accurate description
- ‚úÖ "Responses generated" - Clear meaning
- ‚úÖ "Phase 1 Complete" - Explicit phase indication
- ‚úÖ "Phase 2 Required" - Mandatory next step

### Script Output Example:
```
Phase 1 Results Summary (Responses Generated):
   Test 1: Test_1_SPY_Market_Status - COMPLETED
   Test 2: Test_2_SPY_Current_Price_OHLC - COMPLETED
   ...
   Test 39: Test_39_Multi_Options_Expiration_Dates_WDC_AMD_SOUN - COMPLETED

Total Tests: 39
Completed: 39
Incomplete: 0
Generation Rate: 100%

‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: All responses generated

üî¥ PHASE 2 REQUIRED: Manual Verification Needed

Phase 2 Verification Checklist (for AI Agent):
For EACH of the 39 test responses, verify:
  1. ‚úÖ Response directly addresses the prompt query
  2. ‚úÖ Correct ticker symbols used
  3. ‚úÖ Appropriate tool calls made
  4. ‚úÖ Data formatting matches expected format
  5. ‚úÖ No hallucinated data or made-up values
  6. ‚úÖ Options chains show Bid/Ask columns
  7. ‚úÖ Technical analysis includes proper indicators
  8. ‚úÖ Response is complete (not truncated)

‚ö†Ô∏è  MANDATORY CHECKPOINT QUESTION:
   "Did you verify the results of EACH test prompt to ensure
    the response was correct with proper tool calls and formatting?"
```

## Running Tests

### Phase 1: Execute Test Script

```bash
# Single loop (RECOMMENDED)
chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh

# Multiple loops for validation
chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh 3
```

### Phase 2: Manual Verification

1. **Open test report:**
   ```bash
   cat test-reports/test_cli_regression_loop1_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.log
   ```

2. **For each of 39 responses, verify 8 criteria**

3. **Document issues found** (if any)

4. **Answer checkpoint question:**
   - "Did you verify the results of EACH test prompt?"
   - Must answer YES before proceeding

5. **If issues found:**
   - Fix the issues
   - Re-run Phase 1
   - Re-perform Phase 2
   - Repeat until all responses correct

## Integration with Development Workflow

### When to Run Tests (MANDATORY)

**Required:**
- ‚úÖ Before committing changes to CLI or backend
- ‚úÖ After modifying agent service or tool integration
- ‚úÖ Before creating pull requests
- ‚úÖ After updating OpenAI Agents SDK
- ‚úÖ After adding/modifying AI agent tools
- ‚úÖ Before marking any task as "complete"
- ‚úÖ After changing service_tier configuration
- ‚úÖ After modifying test suite structure
- ‚úÖ After adding new API integrations

**Both phases MUST complete before claiming task complete.**

---

## Pre-Commit Checklist

See `task_completion_checklist.md` for full checklist. Testing requirements:

```bash
# Phase 1: Execute test script
chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh

# Phase 2: Manual verification
# - Review each of 39 responses in test report
# - Verify against 8-point criteria
# - Answer checkpoint question: YES
# - Document any issues found
# - Fix and re-test if needed

# Only proceed to commit after BOTH phases complete
```

**CRITICAL:** Both Phase 1 AND Phase 2 are MANDATORY before any commit.

## API Usage Considerations

**Note:** Each test run makes 39+ real API calls to:
- **Polygon.io**: Financial data (11 tools)
- **Finnhub**: Stock quotes (1 tool)
- **Tradier**: Options expiration dates (1 tool)
- **OpenAI**: GPT-5-Nano (AI agent with service_tier: "default")

**Cost Implications:**
- **Phase 1**: API costs for 39 queries
- **Phase 2**: No additional API costs (manual review)
- **OpenAI**: Tokens consumed (~800-1500 per test, ~30,000-60,000 per full run)

**Best Practice:**
- Run single-loop validation before commits (mandatory)
- Run 3-loop validation for significant changes
- Perform Phase 2 for each loop
- Monitor API usage and costs
