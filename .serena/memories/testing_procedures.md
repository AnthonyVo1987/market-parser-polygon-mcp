## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Classification

| Category | Time Range | Rating |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| EXCELLENT | < 10s | ✅ Expected for all queries (post-MCP removal) |
| GOOD | 10-20s | ✅ Acceptable for complex queries |
| ACCEPTABLE | 20-60s | ⚠️ May need optimization |
| SLOW | > 60s | ❌ Needs investigation |

### Expected Performance (Oct 2025 - Post-MCP Removal)

**Individual Query Performance:**
- **Average**: 6.10s
- **Min**: 5.25s (simple queries)
- **Max**: 7.57s (complex multi-stock queries)
- **Std Dev**: 0.80s (highly consistent)

**Full Test Suite (27 tests):**
- **Duration**: 165-200s (2.75-3.33 minutes)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Consistency**: Very high (0.80s std dev)

### Performance Trends

**MCP Removal Impact (Oct 2025):**
- **Before** (MCP architecture): ~20s avg
- **After** (Direct API): ~6.10s avg
- **Improvement**: 70% faster
- **Reason**: Removed MCP server overhead, direct Python SDK calls

**Architecture Milestones:**
- **Phase 4 Complete**: All 12 tools migrated to Direct API
- **MCP Server**: Completely removed
- **Performance Gain**: 70% faster (6.10s vs 20s)
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate (160/160 tests in baseline)

## Session Persistence Validation

**How It Works:**
1. Script creates single input file with all 27 prompts
2. Single CLI invocation processes all prompts
3. Script verifies session initialized only once
4. Expected: Session persists throughout all tests

**Validation Check:**
```bash
# Count session initializations in output
session_count=$(grep -c "CLI session 'cli_session' initialized" "$RAW_OUTPUT")

if [ "$session_count" -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "✅ Session Persistence: VERIFIED"
else
    echo "❌ Session Persistence: FAILED (count=$session_count)"
fi
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Real users have persistent chat sessions
- Testing must match actual usage patterns
- Session context maintained across queries
- Conversation memory tested

**Validation Status:** ✅ VERIFIED in all recent test runs

## Running Tests

### Quick Test (Single Loop)
```bash
./CLI_test_regression.sh
```

### Performance Baseline (10 Loops)
```bash
./CLI_test_regression.sh 10
```

# View latest report
cat test-reports/cli_regression_test_*.txt | tail -100
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Test Timeout
**Cause:** Response times > 120s (max configured)
**Solution:**
- Increase MAX_RESPONSE_TIME in script
- Check API connectivity
- Verify API keys in .env

### Issue: Session Count > 1
**Cause:** CLI restarting between prompts
**Solution:**
- Verify input file has all prompts with single "exit" at end
- Check CLI_CMD variable is correct
- Review raw output log for restart indicators

### Issue: Missing Response Times
**Cause:** CLI output format changed
**Solution:**
- Check raw output log
- Update parsing logic in script
- Verify CLI performance metrics are enabled

### Issue: Tests Fail
**Cause:** API errors, connectivity issues, or CLI crashes
**Solution:**
- Check raw output log for error messages
- Verify API keys: `cat .env | grep API_KEY`
- Test API connectivity: `curl https://api.polygon.io/v1/meta/symbols/AAPL/company?apiKey=$POLYGON_API_KEY`
- Check OpenAI API status

### Issue: Inconsistent Performance
**Cause:** Network latency, API load
**Solution:**
- Run 10-loop baseline to get average
- Expect 0.80s std dev (normal variation)
- Check for outliers > 15s (may indicate API issues)

## Integration with Development Workflow

### When to Run Tests (MANDATORY)

**Required:**
- ✅ Before committing changes to CLI or backend
- ✅ After modifying agent service or tool integration
- ✅ Before creating pull requests
- ✅ After updating OpenAI Agents SDK
- ✅ After adding/modifying AI agent tools
- ✅ Before marking any task as "complete"

**Recommended:**
- After changing prompt templates
- After modifying API models or response formatting
- During performance optimization work
- When investigating user-reported issues
- After dependency updates

### Pre-Commit Checklist

See `task_completion_checklist.md` for full checklist. Testing requirements:

```bash
# 1. Run CLI regression test
./CLI_test_regression.sh

# 2. Verify results
# - All 27/27 tests PASSED (100% success rate)
# - Average response time < 10s (preferably ~6-8s)
# - Performance rating: EXCELLENT

# 3. Include test report in commit
# - Test report auto-saved to test-reports/
# - Include in git add before commit
```

**CRITICAL:** Test execution is MANDATORY before any commit. See enforcement rules in `task_completion_checklist.md`.

## Test Script Implementation Details

### Input File Generation
```bash
# Array of all 27 prompts
prompts=(
    "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, what is the current Market Status?"
    "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"
    # ... all 27 prompts ...
)

# Create single input file
for prompt in "${prompts[@]}"; do
    echo "$prompt" >> "$INPUT_FILE"
done
echo "exit" >> "$INPUT_FILE"  # Only one exit at the end
```

### CLI Execution
```bash
# Single CLI invocation with all prompts
$CLI_CMD < "$INPUT_FILE" > "$RAW_OUTPUT" 2>&1 &
CLI_PID=$!

# Wait for completion with timeout
wait $CLI_PID
```

### Response Time Extraction
```bash
# Parse output for response times
while IFS= read -r line; do
    if echo "$line" | grep -q "Response Time:"; then
        rt=$(echo "$line" | grep -o '[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+' | head -1)
        response_times+=("$rt")
    fi
done < "$RAW_OUTPUT"
```

### Performance Classification
```bash
# Classify each response time
if (( $(echo "$rt < 10" | bc -l) )); then
    classification="EXCELLENT"
elif (( $(echo "$rt < 20" | bc -l) )); then
    classification="GOOD"
elif (( $(echo "$rt < 60" | bc -l) )); then
    classification="ACCEPTABLE"
else
    classification="SLOW"
fi
```

## Multi-Loop Testing

### Purpose
Multi-loop testing establishes performance baselines and validates consistency.

### Usage
```bash
# 10-loop baseline (recommended for performance validation)
./CLI_test_regression.sh 10
```

### Output
Each loop generates separate report with aggregated summary:
```
Loop 1/10: 27/27 PASSED, Avg: 7.34s
Loop 2/10: 27/27 PASSED, Avg: 5.63s
...
Loop 10/10: 27/27 PASSED, Avg: 5.76s

Overall Baseline:
- Total Tests: 270/270 PASSED (100%)
- Average: 6.10s
- Std Dev: 0.80s
- Min: 5.25s
- Max: 7.57s
```

### When to Run Multi-Loop Tests
- After major architectural changes
- Before production releases
- When validating performance optimizations
- To establish new performance baselines

## API Usage Considerations

**Note:** Each test run makes 27+ real API calls to:
- **Polygon.io**: Financial data (11 tools)
- **Finnhub**: Stock quotes (1 tool)
- **OpenAI**: GPT-5-Nano (AI agent)

**Cost Implications:**
- **Polygon.io**: Counts toward API rate limits
- **Finnhub**: Counts toward API rate limits
- **OpenAI**: Tokens consumed (~800-1500 per test, ~21,600-40,500 per full run)

**Best Practice:**
- Run full test suite before commits (mandatory)
- Run 10-loop baselines sparingly (major changes only)
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Consider API mocking for frequent development testing (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for testing infrastructure:

1. **API Mocking** - Test without live API calls for faster iteration
2. **Parallel Testing** - Run multiple test suites concurrently
3. **Performance Regression Detection** - Alert if avg response time increases > 20%
4. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing on push/PR
5. **Historical Trending** - Track performance metrics over time in database
6. **Load Testing** - Test concurrent user scenarios
7. **Error Injection** - Test error handling and recovery
8. **Visual Regression Testing** - Frontend screenshot comparison
9. **End-to-End Web Testing** - Playwright tests for full web flow
