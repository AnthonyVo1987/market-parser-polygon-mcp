2. **Single Stock Snapshot**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"
3. **Full Market Snapshot**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Full Market Snapshot: SPY, QQQ, IWM"
4. **Closing Price**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, what was the closing price of GME today?"
5. **Performance Analysis**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, how is SOUN performance doing this week?"
6. **Support & Resistance**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Support & Resistance Levels NVDA"
7. **Technical Analysis**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Technical Analysis SPY"
8. **Top Gainers**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Top Market Movers Today for Gainers"
9. **Top Losers**: "Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status Date, Top Market Movers Today for Losers"

### Updated Performance Expectations

#### Response Time Expectations
- **Previous**: 30-60 seconds
- **Current**: 20-45 seconds (improved with GPT-5 optimization)
- **Target**: < 30 seconds for excellent performance

#### Performance Classification
- **SUCCESS**: < 30 seconds (excellent performance with GPT-5 optimization)
- **GOOD**: 30-45 seconds (good performance, within expected range)
- **SLOW_PERFORMANCE**: 45-90 seconds (acceptable but investigate optimization)
- **TIMEOUT**: > 90 seconds (failure - investigate GPT-5 configuration)

### Testing Guidelines

#### For AI Agents
1. **Read test_prompts.md first** before any testing
2. **Select appropriate prompt** based on test requirements
3. **Copy prompt exactly** as written (includes "Quick Response Needed" prefix)
4. **Expect 20-45 second response time** (improved with GPT-5 optimization)
5. **Report actual response time** for performance classification
6. **Verify quick response optimization** is working correctly

#### For Test Documentation
1. **Reference test_prompts.md** in all test guides
2. **Include individual prompts** for quick reference
3. **Link to test_prompts.md** for comprehensive prompt list
4. **Update test_prompts.md** if prompts need modification
