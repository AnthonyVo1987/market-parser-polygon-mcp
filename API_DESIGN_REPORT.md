# Market Parser JSON Schema API Design Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive JSON schema re-architecture for the Market Parser system, replacing the previous text-based parsing approach with robust, schema-validated JSON responses. The new system addresses the production failures experienced with text parsing and provides a foundation for reliable, scalable financial data analysis.

## Core Design Decisions

### 1. Schema Architecture
- **JSON Schema Draft 2020-12** compliance for maximum compatibility
- **Three primary schemas**: Snapshot, Support/Resistance, Technical Analysis
- **Standardized error schema** with detailed field-level validation
- **Versioned schemas** with semantic versioning strategy (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0)

### 2. Data Structure Principles
- **Hierarchical organization**: metadata → data → validation structure
- **Consistent field naming**: snake_case throughout, standardized terminology
- **Comprehensive validation**: Type checking, range validation, business rule enforcement
- **Metadata inclusion**: Timestamp, confidence scores, schema version tracking

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- **RFC 9457-compliant** error responses with structured field errors
- **Programmatic error codes** for automated handling
- **Field-level granularity** with JSON path references
- **Confidence impact scoring** to quantify validation issues

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Validation caching** with TTL-based cache invalidation
- **Streaming validation** for large responses
- **Response size targets**: 1-3KB per analysis type
- **Sub-100ms validation times** for real-time processing
