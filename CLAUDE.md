## Quick Start

__One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):__

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT __DOES NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY__.

```bash
# Option 1: Main startup script (recommended)
./start-app.sh

# Option 2: XTerm version for better terminal compatibility
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 3: Use npm scripts
npm run start:app          # Main script
npm run start:app:xterm    # XTerm version
```

__Prerequisites:__ uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (Main Script)

- __Terminal Support__: Tries `gnome-terminal` first, falls back to `xterm`
- __Cross-Platform__: Works on most Linux distributions and macOS
- __Automatic Fallback__: Gracefully handles missing terminal emulators

### start-app-xterm.sh (XTerm Version)

- __XTerm Focused__: Specifically designed for xterm users
- __Window Positioning__: Places backend and frontend terminals side-by-side
- __Font Configuration__: Uses readable DejaVu Sans Mono font
- __Enhanced Display__: Better window titles and layout

## What the Scripts Do

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- __Preserves MCP servers__ - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- __Backend__: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- __Frontend__: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- __NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP__

__Access:__ <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

__Manual Setup:__

```bash
# 1. Environment setup

## Testing Protocol Guidelines

__CRITICAL__: Follow these mandatory protocols to prevent testing failures and ensure professional standards.

### Core Protocol Requirements

1. __User-Specified Test Plans Are Sacred__
   - NEVER substitute user-provided test procedures with AI-generated alternatives
   - Test plans must be followed exactly as specified, including sequence, messages, and steps
   - Deviating from specified procedures can invalidate results and mask critical issues

2. __Verification Before Execution__
   - Always confirm the exact test plan before beginning any testing phase
   - If test details are unclear due to context loss, ASK for clarification first
   - State what test plan will be executed and request confirmation

3. __Context Loss Handling__
   - When conversation compacting occurs, proactively request clarification on procedural details
   - Never assume "equivalent" procedures are acceptable
   - Professional testing requires exact adherence to specifications

4. __Testing Standards__
   - Test procedures have critical reasoning behind specific sequences and steps
   - Communication before action: ask when uncertain rather than assume
   - Document any deviations with explicit user approval

### Corrective Actions Applied

- __Mandatory Pre-Test Verification__: Confirm test plan details before execution
- __No Substitutions Policy__: User procedures must be followed exactly
- __Assumption Elimination__: Replace assumptions with verification requests
- __Professional Standards__: Recognize testing as critical validation requiring precision

### Build & Production

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Serve production build
npm run serve

# Bundle analysis
npm run analyze
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Agent System with MCP Server Integration

The core architecture uses the OpenAI Agents SDK with Polygon.io MCP server for financial data:

1. __MCP Server Factory Pattern__ (`src/backend/main.py:42`)
   - Creates stdio MCP server with Polygon.io API integration
   - Manages server lifecycle with FastAPI lifespan events
   - Shared server instance across all API requests

2. __Financial Guardrail System__
   - Two-agent architecture: guardrail agent + analysis agent
   - Guardrail validates finance-related queries before processing
   - Prevents non-financial queries from consuming API resources

3. __Unified Response Processing__
   - All responses use conversational format (no JSON extraction)
   - Emoji-based sentiment indicators (üìà bullish, üìâ bearish)
   - Structured format: KEY TAKEAWAYS ‚Üí DETAILED ANALYSIS ‚Üí DISCLAIMER

### Prompt Template System

The prompt management system (`src/backend/prompt_templates.py`) provides:

1. __Template Types__: Snapshot, Support/Resistance, Technical Analysis
2. __Ticker Extraction__: Smart detection from company names and context
3. __Conversation Context__: Maintains ticker history across chat sessions
4. __Unified Conversational Mode__: All templates generate natural language responses

### FastAPI Backend Architecture

The backend (`src/backend/main.py`) features:

1. __Hard-coded Configuration__: Ports and hosts are fixed (127.0.0.1:8000)
2. __Shared Resources__: Single MCP server and SQLite session across requests
3. __Multiple API Versions__: Legacy endpoints + v1 API for compatibility
4. __CORS Support__: Dynamic configuration for frontend integration

### React Frontend Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via:

1. __RESTful API__: Chat endpoint + analysis endpoints
2. __Fixed Ports__: Backend on 8000, frontend dev on 3000, production on 5500
3. __One-click Startup__: `start-app.sh` manages both servers automatically

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Agent Processing Pipeline

```python
# Simplified flow in process_financial_query()
1. Input validation & sanitization
2. Guardrail check (finance validation)
3. Agent processing with MCP tools
4. Response formatting with emojis
5. Error handling with typed responses
```

### Prompt Template Architecture

```python
# Template generation flow
TickerExtractor.extract_ticker() ‚Üí TickerContext
PromptTemplate.generate_prompt() ‚Üí formatted prompt
ResponseManager.process() ‚Üí conversational response
```

### FastAPI Lifespan Management

```python
# Shared resource initialization
async with lifespan(app):
    shared_mcp_server = create_polygon_mcp_server()
    shared_session = SQLiteSession()
    # All requests use these shared instances
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (in `.env`):

```bash
# Required API keys
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Logging configuration (default for performance)
LOG_MODE=NONE

# Optional pricing (USD per 1M tokens)
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=0.25
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=2.00
```

Server configuration is hard-coded (not configurable via environment):

- Backend: 127.0.0.1:8000
- Frontend Dev: 127.0.0.1:3000
- Frontend Production: 127.0.0.1:5500 (Live Server)

## Testing Strategy

The project uses Playwright MCP Tools for E2E testing - the ONLY testing method:

__MCP Tools Testing Approach:__

- Playwright MCP Tools for browser automation and React GUI testing
- 3 core test validation: Market Status, NVDA Ticker, Stock Snapshot Button
- Comprehensive test coverage for all financial query scenarios
- See `/tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md` for testing procedures

## Prototyping Principles

__CRITICAL PROJECT STAGE NOTICE:__ This project is currently in the prototyping stage. All development work must adhere to the following principles:

### Core Prototyping Requirements

- __Do NOT over-engineer ANYTHING__ - Focus on functional prototypes, not perfect solutions
- __Prioritize functionality over optimization__ - Get features working before making them efficient
- __Maintain prototype simplicity__ - Avoid complex architectural patterns unless absolutely necessary

### NOT REQUIRED for Prototyping Stage

- __Enterprise Grade solutions__ - Simple, functional implementations are preferred
- __Production Ready implementations__ - Focus on demonstrating functionality
- __Performance Optimization__ - Optimize only if performance blocks functionality
- __Comprehensive Testing__ - Basic functional validation is sufficient
- __Test Scripts or Unit Tests__ - Manual testing is acceptable for prototyping
- __CI/CD Pipeline implementation__ - Basic git workflows are sufficient

### Prototyping Development Guidelines

- __Rapid iteration over perfect implementation__ - Build, test, learn, iterate
- __Functional completeness over code quality__ - Make it work first, refine later
- __Future scalability awareness without over-engineering__ - Consider future needs but don't implement them yet
- __Documentation focused on usage, not internal architecture__ - Help users understand what it does, not how it works internally

All AI Agents, Sub-Agents, & Agent Team Specialists development work must respect these prototyping constraints to maintain project momentum and avoid premature optimization.
