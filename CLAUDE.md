## Tools Usage

When working with tools, prioritize the following MCP Tools FIRST in any particular order to match the scope & complexity of the task(s), before trying to use standard non-prioritized tools:

- **Serena MCP**: Advanced code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring
- **Sequential-Thinking MCP**:  Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
- **Context7 MCP**: Researching Best, Robust, & Up to Date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for React GUI testing & App Validation
- **Filesystem MCP**: File operations, configuration management, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management (use for batch operations, file discovery, metadata analysis, and project organization).  *DO NOT USE Filesystem Tools for for single-file content modifications and instead use standard Read/Write/Edit Tools*

Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations.

- **If more proper Tool Usage details are needed, refer to & read relevant Tools Usage Guides as needed in 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide'**

## Quick Start

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

# Option 1: Run one click  quick start script directly (recommended)

./start-app.sh

```bash
# Option 2: Use npm script 
# Prerequisites: uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env
npm run start:app
```

# Option 1: Run one click Quick start script directly (recommended)

./start-app.sh

# Option 2: Use npm script

```bash
# Prerequisites: uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env
npm run start:app
```

# Option 3: Use xterm version for better terminal compatibility one click Quick start script directly

./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 4: Use xterm version npm command directly

```bash
npm run start:app:xterm
```

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (Main Script)

- **Terminal Support**: Tries `gnome-terminal` first, falls back to `xterm`
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on most Linux distributions and macOS
- **Automatic Fallback**: Gracefully handles missing terminal emulators

### start-app-xterm.sh (XTerm Version)

- **XTerm Focused**: Specifically designed for xterm users
- **Window Positioning**: Places backend and frontend terminals side-by-side
- **Font Configuration**: Uses readable DejaVu Sans Mono font
- **Enhanced Display**: Better window titles and layout

## What the Scripts Do

### ðŸ”„ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### ðŸš€ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### âœ… Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

**Manual Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Environment setup
cp .env.example .env
# Add POLYGON_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env

# 2. Install dependencies
uv install
npm install

# 3. Start servers (2 terminals)
# Terminal 1: Backend
uv run uvicorn src.backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend
npm run frontend:dev
```

**Access:** Frontend at <http://127.0.0.1:3000>, Backend at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

## Development Commands

## Testing Protocol Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these mandatory protocols to prevent testing failures and ensure professional standards.

### Core Protocol Requirements

1. **User-Specified Test Plans Are Sacred**
   - NEVER substitute user-provided test procedures with AI-generated alternatives
   - Test plans must be followed exactly as specified, including sequence, messages, and steps
   - Deviating from specified procedures can invalidate results and mask critical issues

2. **Verification Before Execution**
   - Always confirm the exact test plan before beginning any testing phase
   - If test details are unclear due to context loss, ASK for clarification first
   - State what test plan will be executed and request confirmation

3. **Context Loss Handling**
   - When conversation compacting occurs, proactively request clarification on procedural details
   - Never assume "equivalent" procedures are acceptable
   - Professional testing requires exact adherence to specifications

4. **Testing Standards**
   - Test procedures have critical reasoning behind specific sequences and steps
   - Communication before action: ask when uncertain rather than assume
   - Document any deviations with explicit user approval

### Corrective Actions Applied

- **Mandatory Pre-Test Verification**: Confirm test plan details before execution
- **No Substitutions Policy**: User procedures must be followed exactly
- **Assumption Elimination**: Replace assumptions with verification requests
- **Professional Standards**: Recognize testing as critical validation requiring precision

### Build & Production

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Serve production build
npm run serve

# Bundle analysis
npm run analyze
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Agent System with MCP Server Integration

The core architecture uses the OpenAI Agents SDK with Polygon.io MCP server for financial data:

1. **MCP Server Factory Pattern** (`src/backend/main.py:42`)
   - Creates stdio MCP server with Polygon.io API integration
   - Manages server lifecycle with FastAPI lifespan events
   - Shared server instance across all API requests

2. **Financial Guardrail System**
   - Two-agent architecture: guardrail agent + analysis agent
   - Guardrail validates finance-related queries before processing
   - Prevents non-financial queries from consuming API resources

3. **Unified Response Processing**
   - All responses use conversational format (no JSON extraction)
   - Emoji-based sentiment indicators (ðŸ“ˆ bullish, ðŸ“‰ bearish)
   - Structured format: KEY TAKEAWAYS â†’ DETAILED ANALYSIS â†’ DISCLAIMER

### Prompt Template System

The prompt management system (`src/backend/prompt_templates.py`) provides:

1. **Template Types**: Snapshot, Support/Resistance, Technical Analysis
2. **Ticker Extraction**: Smart detection from company names and context
3. **Conversation Context**: Maintains ticker history across chat sessions
4. **Unified Conversational Mode**: All templates generate natural language responses

### FastAPI Backend Architecture

The backend (`src/backend/main.py`) features:

1. **Hard-coded Configuration**: Ports and hosts are fixed (127.0.0.1:8000)
2. **Shared Resources**: Single MCP server and SQLite session across requests
3. **Multiple API Versions**: Legacy endpoints + v1 API for compatibility
4. **CORS Support**: Dynamic configuration for frontend integration

### React Frontend Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via:

1. **RESTful API**: Chat endpoint + analysis endpoints
2. **Fixed Ports**: Backend on 8000, frontend dev on 3000, production on 5500
3. **One-click Startup**: `start-app.sh` manages both servers automatically

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Agent Processing Pipeline

```python
# Simplified flow in process_financial_query()
1. Input validation & sanitization
2. Guardrail check (finance validation)
3. Agent processing with MCP tools
4. Response formatting with emojis
5. Error handling with typed responses
```

### Prompt Template Architecture

```python
# Template generation flow
TickerExtractor.extract_ticker() â†’ TickerContext
PromptTemplate.generate_prompt() â†’ formatted prompt
ResponseManager.process() â†’ conversational response
```

### FastAPI Lifespan Management

```python
# Shared resource initialization
async with lifespan(app):
    shared_mcp_server = create_polygon_mcp_server()
    shared_session = SQLiteSession()
    # All requests use these shared instances
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (in `.env`):

```bash
# Required API keys
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional pricing (USD per 1M tokens)
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=0.25
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=2.00
```

Server configuration is hard-coded (not configurable via environment):

- Backend: 127.0.0.1:8000
- Frontend Dev: 127.0.0.1:3000
- Frontend Production: 127.0.0.1:5500

## Testing Strategy

The project uses Playwright MCP Tools for E2E testing - the ONLY testing method:

**MCP Tools Testing Approach:**

- Playwright MCP Tools for browser automation and React GUI testing
- 3 core test validation: Market Status, NVDA Ticker, Stock Snapshot Button
- Comprehensive test coverage for all financial query scenarios
- See `/tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md` for testing procedures

## Prototyping Principles

**CRITICAL PROJECT STAGE NOTICE:** This project is currently in the prototyping stage. All development work must adhere to the following principles:

### Core Prototyping Requirements

- **Do NOT over-engineer ANYTHING** - Focus on functional prototypes, not perfect solutions
- **Prioritize functionality over optimization** - Get features working before making them efficient
- **Maintain prototype simplicity** - Avoid complex architectural patterns unless absolutely necessary

### NOT REQUIRED for Prototyping Stage

- **Enterprise Grade solutions** - Simple, functional implementations are preferred
- **Production Ready implementations** - Focus on demonstrating functionality
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimize only if performance blocks functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Basic functional validation is sufficient
- **Test Scripts or Unit Tests** - Manual testing is acceptable for prototyping
- **CI/CD Pipeline implementation** - Basic git workflows are sufficient

### Prototyping Development Guidelines

- **Rapid iteration over perfect implementation** - Build, test, learn, iterate
- **Functional completeness over code quality** - Make it work first, refine later
- **Future scalability awareness without over-engineering** - Consider future needs but don't implement them yet
- **Documentation focused on usage, not internal architecture** - Help users understand what it does, not how it works internally

All AI Agents, Sub-Agents, & Agent Team Specialists development work must respect these prototyping constraints to maintain project momentum and avoid premature optimization.
