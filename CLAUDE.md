# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides conversational responses to user queries and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

## Recent Updates

The project has been recently updated to consolidate migration documentation into a single comprehensive guide. See `/docs/deprecated/OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete migration instructions (legacy documentation archived).

## Prototyping Principles (ENFORCED)

**CRITICAL PROJECT STAGE NOTICE:** This project is currently in the prototyping stage. All development work must adhere to the following principles:

### Core Prototyping Requirements

- **Do NOT over-engineer ANYTHING** - Focus on functional prototypes, not perfect solutions
- **Prioritize functionality over optimization** - Get features working before making them efficient
- **Maintain prototype simplicity** - Avoid complex architectural patterns unless absolutely necessary

### NOT REQUIRED for Prototyping Stage

- **Enterprise Grade solutions** - Simple, functional implementations are preferred
- **Production Ready implementations** - Focus on demonstrating functionality
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimize only if performance blocks functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Basic functional validation is sufficient
- **Test Scripts or Unit Tests** - Manual testing is acceptable for prototyping
- **CI/CD Pipeline implementation** - Basic git workflows are sufficient

### Prototyping Development Guidelines

- **Rapid iteration over perfect implementation** - Build, test, learn, iterate
- **Functional completeness over code quality** - Make it work first, refine later
- **Future scalability awareness without over-engineering** - Consider future needs but don't implement them yet
- **Documentation focused on usage, not internal architecture** - Help users understand what it does, not how it works internally

All specialists and development work must respect these prototyping constraints to maintain project momentum and avoid premature optimization.

```

### Step 4: GUI Setup - Vite Development Server (Recommended)

**Open a new terminal for the frontend:**

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**

```
> frontend-openai@0.0.0 dev
> vite --mode development

  VITE v5.4.19  ready in 220 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: http://172.29.229.155:3000/
  ➜  Network: http://172.17.0.1:3000/
```

**Verify Frontend Configuration:**

```bash
# Check that frontend can reach backend API
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Should load the React application

# Verify API connection in browser console:
# Open http://localhost:3000/ → F12 Developer Tools → Console
# Should show no CORS or connection errors
```

**Access the GUI:** Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser

### Step 5: GUI Setup - Live Server Production (Alternative)

**If you prefer production-optimized serving:**

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Build production assets
npm run build

# Start Live Server (requires VS Code Live Server extension)
cd dist
live-server --port=5501 --host=127.0.0.1 --no-browser --wait=1000
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Serving "/path/to/frontend_OpenAI/dist" at http://127.0.0.1:5501
Ready for changes
```

**Access the GUI:** Open <http://127.0.0.1:5501/> in your browser

### ✅ Complete System Status Check

**After following all steps, you should have:**

1. **FastAPI Backend** running on <http://0.0.0.0:8000> (startup complete)
2. **CLI Interface** working with financial data queries and emoji-based responses
3. **Vite Dev Server** running on <http://localhost:3000/> (220ms startup) OR
4. **Live Server** running on <http://127.0.0.1:5501/> (production build)

**Test the complete system:**

- CLI: Ask "tell me about NVDA stock" - should get emoji-enhanced financial analysis
- GUI: Open browser, type financial queries - should get same enhanced responses
- Both interfaces should show identical emoji-based sentiment indicators (📈📉💰)

### 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

**Backend Issues:**

- **Missing API keys**: Check .env file has both POLYGON_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- **Port 8000 busy**: Set `FASTAPI_PORT=8001` in .env file OR change port with `--port 8001`
- **uv not found**: Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Backend not responding**: Verify with `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

**Port Configuration Issues:**

```bash
# Check which process is using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
# Kill process if needed: kill -9 <PID>

# Use different backend port
echo "FASTAPI_PORT=8001" >> .env
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# Update frontend to match custom backend port
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001" >> frontend/.env
```

**Environment Configuration Options:**

**Backend Configuration (.env):**

- **POLYGON_API_KEY**: Your Polygon.io API key (required)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- **FASTAPI_HOST**: Server host address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- **FASTAPI_PORT**: Server port number (default: 8000)
- **OPENAI_MODEL**: AI model to use (default: gpt-5-mini)
- **AGENT_SESSION_NAME**: SQLite session name (default: finance_conversation)
- **MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**: MCP server timeout (default: 120.0)
- **CORS_ORIGINS**: Comma-separated allowed origins for CORS

**Frontend Configuration (frontend/.env):**

- **VITE_API_URL**: Backend API base URL (default: <http://localhost:8000>)
- **VITE_APP_TITLE**: Application title (optional)

**Configuration Examples:**

```bash
# Development with default ports
# Backend .env:
FASTAPI_HOST=0.0.0.0
FASTAPI_PORT=8000

# Frontend frontend/.env:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Development with custom ports (port conflicts)
# Backend .env:
FASTAPI_HOST=0.0.0.0
FASTAPI_PORT=8001

# Frontend frontend/.env:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

**Frontend Issues:**

- **npm install fails**: Update Node.js to 18+ and try again
- **Port 3000 busy**: Vite will auto-select next available port (check console output)
- **CORS errors**: Verify VITE_API_URL matches backend port, ensure backend is running
- **API connection failed**: Check backend health endpoint and network configuration
- **Live Server not found**: Install VS Code Live Server extension

**API Issues:**

- **MCP server errors**: Ensure uvx is in PATH and Polygon API key is correct
- **Connection timeout**: Increase MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in .env file

**Port Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check if frontend is accessible
curl http://localhost:3000/

# List all listening ports
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
netstat -tlnp | grep :3000

# Test end-to-end API connection

### Security Requirements

- Never commit API keys (use .env file)
- All export functionality uses secure file operations
- Input validation via `src/security_utils.py`
- Sensitive data automatically redacted in logs

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Test Plan Compliance

#### SPECIALISTS CANNOT MAKE UP THEIR OWN TESTS

When tests are run or requested and a specialist does not recognize the test, it means the specialist MUST read the official test plan from:

`/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md`

**This document contains:**

- Complete 51-test suite specifications (P001-P013 priority tests + comprehensive tests)
- Exact test procedures and expected results
- Official testing methodology and validation criteria
- Required MCP tools and implementation patterns

**Failure to follow the official test plan invalidates all test results.**

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Testing Integrity and False Reporting Prevention

**MANDATORY TESTING INTEGRITY PROTOCOLS (Established 2025-01-10):**

#### Absolute Requirements for Test Reporting

**✅ REQUIRED BEFORE GENERATING ANY TEST REPORT:**

1. **Complete All Tests First**: NEVER generate completion reports until ALL required tests are executed
2. **Verify Todo List Status**: Check todo list shows ALL tests marked as "completed" before claiming success
3. **Document Actual Results**: Report actual test outcomes including failures, not desired outcomes
4. **Sequential Execution**: Complete tests in proper sequence without skipping or premature reporting

**❌ STRICTLY PROHIBITED ACTIONS:**

- ❌ **FALSE COMPLETION CLAIMS**: Never claim test completion when tests are still pending/incomplete
- ❌ **PREMATURE REPORTING**: Never generate reports before finishing all required test executions
- ❌ **FABRICATED VALIDATION**: Never claim "PASSED" or "VALIDATED" status with incomplete testing
- ❌ **IGNORED TODO STATUS**: Never ignore todo list showing pending tasks while claiming completion

#### Mandatory Verification Checklist

**Before generating any test completion report, MUST verify:**

1. **✅ All Tests Executed**: Every required test has been run to completion
2. **✅ Todo List Verification**: All test tasks show "completed" status in todo list
3. **✅ Actual Results Documented**: Real test outcomes (including failures) are captured
4. **✅ No Pending Tasks**: No test-related tasks remain in "pending" or "in_progress" status

#### Corrective Actions for Testing Violations

**If Testing Integrity Violation Occurs:**

1. **Immediate Deletion**: Delete any false/incomplete reports immediately upon discovery
2. **Complete Restart**: Begin full test execution from the beginning with proper protocols
3. **Honest Documentation**: Create accurate reports documenting actual results including failures
4. **Process Review**: Follow established verification checklist before any future reporting

#### Quality Control Standards

**Testing Process Integrity:**

- **Truth Over Speed**: Accurate documentation is more valuable than quick reporting
- **Failure Documentation**: Honest failure reporting is essential for system improvement
- **Protocol Adherence**: Follow testing procedures completely, not partially
- **Verification Requirements**: Multiple verification steps prevent false reporting

**Documentation Standards:**

- **Accurate Status Reporting**: Only claim "PASSED" when all tests genuinely completed successfully
- **Honest Failure Analysis**: Document failures, errors, and incomplete results transparently
- **Complete Coverage**: Report on ALL required tests, not just successful ones
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: Support all completion claims with verifiable evidence

**Example of Proper Test Completion Flow:**

```
1. Execute TEST-B001 → Mark todo as completed
2. Execute TEST-B002 → Mark todo as completed
3. Execute TEST-B003 → Mark todo as completed
4. Execute TEST-B004 → Mark todo as completed
5. Execute TEST-B005 → Mark todo as completed
6. Execute TEST-B006 → Mark todo as completed
7. Verify ALL todos show "completed" status
8. ONLY THEN generate test completion report
```

**This protocol prevents the critical testing integrity violation that occurred on 2025-01-10 where a completion report was generated after only 2/6 tests were completed.**

### Testing Best Practices

- All new features require test coverage
- Performance tests validate system functionality using **30-second polling methodology**
- Integration tests confirm end-to-end workflows with **120s configurable timeout**
- FSM tests ensure state transition integrity
- **Priority testing** uses 3-test core suite (P001-P003) for rapid validation
- **30s polling intervals** enable early detection of successful operations

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Browser Testing Protocol

**Same Browser Instance Requirement**: ALL browser tests MUST execute in one continuous browser session

**✅ CORRECT METHODOLOGY (ENFORCED):**

- **Single Session Rule**: Browser opens once, all tests run in same instance, browser closes once
- **Real-World Simulation**: Mimics actual user behavior staying in same application
- **State Preservation**: Maintains session data, UI state, performance characteristics
- **Continuous Testing**: ALL tests (P001-P013, or any sequence) in SAME browser instance

**❌ INCORRECT METHODOLOGY (PROHIBITED):**

- ❌ New browser → Run Priority Tests → Close browser
- ❌ New browser → Run Performance Tests → Close browser
- ❌ New browser → Run Button Tests → Close browser
- ❌ Any pattern that opens/closes browser between test groups
- ❌ Fresh browser state between related test sequences

**⚠️ BROWSER INSTANCE REQUIREMENT**: ALL tests in a sequence MUST execute in the SAME browser instance. Opening new browser instances between test groups does NOT simulate real-world usage and invalidates session state continuity testing.

### Import Patterns

```python
# Core modules
from src.response_manager import ResponseManager, ProcessingMode
from src.response_parser import ResponseParser
from src.prompt_templates import PromptTemplateManager

# FSM components
from stock_data_fsm.states import AppState, StateContext
from stock_data_fsm.manager import StateManager

# Security utilities
from src.security_utils import validate_input, sanitize_data
```

## System Configuration
