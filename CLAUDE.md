## STANDARDIZED TEST PROMPTS

__CRITICAL:__ All testing MUST use these standardized prompts to ensure
consistent, quick responses (30-60 seconds) and avoid false failures from
complex prompts.

### Quick Response Test Prompts (Use These Only)

1. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: What is the current
   Market Status?"__
2. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"__
3. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Full Market Snapshot: SPY, QQQ, IWM"__
4. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, what was the closing price of GME today?"__
5. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, how is SOUN performance doing this week?"__
6. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Top Market Movers Today for Gainers"__
7. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Top Market Movers Today for Losers"__
8. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Support & Resistance Levels NVDA"__
9. __"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Technical Analysis SPY"__

__MANDATORY RULES:__

- ‚úÖ Use ONLY these prompts for testing
- ‚úÖ Copy prompts EXACTLY as written
- ‚úÖ Expected response time: 30-60 seconds
- ‚ùå DO NOT create custom prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT modify these prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT use complex, open-ended queries

__üìã COMPLETE PROMPT REFERENCE:__ For the full standardized test
prompts documentation, see `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`

## üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop

using tools - continue using them until tasks completion!!!! üî¥

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout
the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must
continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them
  before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation
  at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation,
   Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices
   & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search
   with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm
   development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file
   content modifications
4. Use Filesystem Tools for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery,
   configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project
   structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project
   management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content
   modifications
5. Use Standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications,
   simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for
   complex analysis, batch operations, and project management
6. Use Playwright Tools for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
7. üî¥ REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

TOOL OVERLAP RESOLUTION:

- Filesystem Tools: Use for 3+ file operations, batch processing, project
  management, metadata analysis, comprehensive project operations
- Standard Read/Write/Edit: Use for single-file modifications, simple
  edits, direct file operations
- Serena Tools: Use for complex code analysis, symbol manipulation,
  pattern search with context
- When in doubt: Use Filesystem for batch/complex operations, Standard
  for simple single-file operations

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're
  failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch
  operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as
needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the
right tool for the right operation

## Quick Start

__One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):__

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT __DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY__.

```bash
# Option 1: Main startup script (recommended)
./start-app.sh
```

__Prerequisites:__ uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (Main Script)

- __Terminal Support__: Tries `gnome-terminal` first, falls back to `xterm`
- __Cross-Platform__: Works on most Linux distributions and macOS
- __Automatic Fallback__: Gracefully handles missing terminal emulators

## What the Scripts Do

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- __Preserves MCP servers__ - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- __Backend__: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- __Frontend__: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- __NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY__

__Access:__ <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ‚ö° High-Performance UI

- __Lightning Fast Loading__: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- __Optimized Performance__: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- __Smooth Interactions__: All UI interactions are instant and responsive
- __Memory Efficient__: Optimized memory usage with 13.8MB heap size
- __Accessibility First__: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Natural Language Financial Queries

Ask questions like:

- `Tesla stock price analysis`
- `AAPL volume trends this week`
- `Show me MSFT support and resistance levels`

### Enhanced Response Format

Responses use a structured format with clear sentiment analysis:

```text
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ NVDA showing strong bullish momentum with 12% weekly gain
‚Ä¢ Strong earnings beat with $35.08B revenue (+122% YoY)
‚Ä¢ AI chip demand driving continued growth trajectory

DETAILED ANALYSIS
[Comprehensive analysis with clear directional indicators]
```

### Multiple Interfaces

- __React Web App__ - Modern responsive interface with real-time chat
- __Enhanced CLI__ - Terminal interface with rich formatting
- __API Endpoints__ - RESTful API for integration

## Example Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
2. Type your financial query
3. Get instant structured responses with sentiment analysis

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

__Backend not starting:__

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

__Frontend connection errors:__

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

__API key issues:__

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
