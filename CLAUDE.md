GPT-5-nano via the OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9.

## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->
feat: implement enhanced tool guidance architecture with scenario-based tool selection

- Add comprehensive tool guidance for common financial data scenarios in agent_service.py
- Restrict AI agent to 10 specific Polygon MCP tools with explicit tool selection guidance
- Implement scenario-based tool recommendations (single vs multiple tickers, options, etc.)
- Add tool guidance for optimal API usage patterns and performance optimization
- Update agent instructions with clear tool selection logic and usage examples
- Eliminate MCP Proxy dependency issues with client-side tool filtering approach
- Add comprehensive testing validation with 100% test success rate (7/7 tests passed)
- Create detailed Serena memories for enhanced tool guidance architecture
- Update project documentation with new tool guidance implementation details
- Add test reports showing improved performance (21-44s response times)
- Remove outdated TODO_task_plan.md and update new_task_plan.md with current tasks

BREAKING CHANGE: AI agent now restricted to 10 specific tools with mandatory tool guidance
PERFORMANCE: Multi-ticker queries now use single get_snapshot_all() call vs multiple individual calls
TESTING: All 7 comprehensive tests passing with enhanced tool selection validation

# üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
4. Use Filesystem Tools for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications
5. Use Standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications, simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for complex analysis, batch operations, and project management
6. Use Playwright Tools for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
7. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

TOOL OVERLAP RESOLUTION:

- Filesystem Tools: Use for 3+ file operations, batch processing, project management, metadata analysis, comprehensive project operations
- Standard Read/Write/Edit: Use for single-file modifications, simple edits, direct file operations
- Serena Tools: Use for complex code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context
- When in doubt: Use Filesystem for batch/complex operations, Standard for simple single-file operations

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## Quick Start

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (NOW WORKING - FIXED)
./start-app.sh  # ‚úÖ WORKING: Script now exits cleanly with timeout
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (NOW WORKING - FIXED)

- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Script now exits cleanly with timeout mechanism
- **Features**: 30-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging
- **Environment Support**: Works in both X11 and WSL2/headless environments
- **Background Mode**: Uses background processes in WSL2, terminal windows in X11
- **Logging**: Writes server logs to backend.log and frontend.log in WSL2 mode

## What the Scripts Do

### ‚è∞ Timeout Mechanism

Both scripts now include a **30-second timeout fallback** to prevent hanging:

- **Normal Operation**: Scripts typically complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Safety Net**: 30-second timeout ensures scripts never hang indefinitely
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Prevents AI agents from getting stuck waiting for script completion
- **Graceful Exit**: Scripts exit cleanly after server verification or timeout

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ‚ö° High-Performance UI

- **Lightning Fast Loading**: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Optimized Performance**: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Smooth Interactions**: All UI interactions are instant and responsive
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage with 13.8MB heap size
- **Accessibility First**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Natural Language Financial Queries

Ask questions like:

- `Tesla stock price analysis`
- `AAPL volume trends this week`
- `Show me MSFT support and resistance levels`

### Multiple Interfaces

- **React Web App** - Modern responsive interface with real-time chat
- **Enhanced CLI** - Terminal interface with rich formatting
- **API Endpoints** - RESTful API for integration

## Example Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
2. Type your financial query
3. Get instant structured responses with sentiment analysis

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9 and Polygon.io MCP integration v0.4.1
- **Frontend**: React 18.2+ with Vite 5.2+ and TypeScript
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E test suite
- **Deployment**: Fixed ports (8000/3000/5500) with one-click startup

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
