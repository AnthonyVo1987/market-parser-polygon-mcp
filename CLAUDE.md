# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and React web application for natural
language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI
GPT-5-nano via the OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9.

## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->

## STANDARDIZED TEST PROMPTS

**CRITICAL:** All testing MUST use these standardized prompts to ensure
consistent, quick responses (30-60 seconds) and avoid false failures from
complex prompts.

### Quick Response Test Prompts (Use These Only)

**MANDATORY RULES:**

- ‚úÖ Use ONLY these prompts for testing
- ‚úÖ Copy prompts EXACTLY as written
- ‚úÖ Expected response time: 30-60 seconds
- ‚ùå DO NOT create custom prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT modify these prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT use complex, open-ended queries

**üìã COMPLETE PROMPT REFERENCE:** For the full standardized test
prompts documentation, see `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`

## üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop

using tools - continue using them until tasks completion!!!! üî¥

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout
the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must
continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them
  before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation
  at every step

7. üî¥ REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're
  failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch
  operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as
needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the
right tool for the right operation

## Quick Start

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (CURRENTLY BROKEN - DO NOT USE)
# ./start-app.sh  # ‚ö†Ô∏è BROKEN: Script gets stuck and blocks execution
```

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (CURRENTLY BROKEN - DO NOT USE)

- **Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN - Script gets stuck and blocks execution
- **Issue**: Cannot proceed to sleep 15 or Playwright testing
- **Action**: Keep script file but do not use until fixed
- **Alternative**: Use start-app-xterm.sh instead

## What the Scripts Do

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ‚ö° High-Performance UI

- **Lightning Fast Loading**: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Optimized Performance**: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Smooth Interactions**: All UI interactions are instant and responsive
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage with 13.8MB heap size
- **Accessibility First**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Natural Language Financial Queries

Ask questions like:

- `Tesla stock price analysis`
- `AAPL volume trends this week`
- `Show me MSFT support and resistance levels`

### Multiple Interfaces

- **React Web App** - Modern responsive interface with real-time chat
- **Enhanced CLI** - Terminal interface with rich formatting
- **API Endpoints** - RESTful API for integration

## Example Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
2. Type your financial query
3. Get instant structured responses with sentiment analysis

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9 and Polygon.io MCP integration v0.4.1
- **Frontend**: React 18.2+ with Vite 5.2+ and TypeScript
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E test suite
- **Deployment**: Fixed ports (8000/3000/5500) with one-click startup

## Development

### Available Commands

```bash
# Application startup
npm run start:app          # One-click startup
npm run frontend:dev       # Frontend development
npm run build             # Production build

# Testing with Playwright MCP Tools only - see `/tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md`

# Code quality
npm run lint              # All linting
npm run type-check        # TypeScript validation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
