## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->
ta-indicators: Add 4 Technical Analysis Indicator tools using Polygon Python Library direct API

- Created 4 new TA indicator custom tools: get_ta_sma, get_ta_ema, get_ta_rsi, get_ta_macd
- Expanded from 10 to 14 total tools (7 Polygon MCP + 1 Finnhub + 6 Polygon direct)
- Updated AI Agent instructions with RULE #8 for Technical Analysis Indicators
- Extended test suite from 7 to 11 tests (added 4 TA indicator test cases)
- All tools follow established @function_tool pattern with comprehensive docstrings

Implementation Details:
‚úÖ Created 4 TA indicator tools in src/backend/tools/polygon_tools.py (604 lines added)

- get_ta_sma: Simple Moving Average (common windows: 20, 50, 200 days)
- get_ta_ema: Exponential Moving Average (common windows: 12, 20, 26, 50 days)
- get_ta_rsi: Relative Strength Index (14-day standard, 0-100 range, >70 overbought, <30 oversold)
- get_ta_macd: MACD indicator (12/26/9 standard periods, crossovers signal trend changes)
‚úÖ Updated agent_service.py imports and create_agent() function with all 4 TA tools
‚úÖ Added RULE #8 to agent instructions with full TA indicator guidance and examples
‚úÖ Updated test_7_prompts_persistent_session.sh from 7 to 11 tests (4 new TA test cases)

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->

## üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

üî¥ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## Quick Start

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (NOW WORKING - FIXED)
./start-app.sh  # ‚úÖ WORKING: Script now exits cleanly with timeout
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (NOW WORKING - FIXED)

- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Script now exits cleanly with timeout mechanism
- **Features**: 30-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging
- **Environment Support**: Works in both X11 and WSL2/headless environments
- **Background Mode**: Uses background processes in WSL2, terminal windows in X11
- **Logging**: Writes server logs to backend.log and frontend.log in WSL2 mode

## What the Scripts Do

### ‚è∞ Timeout Mechanism

Both scripts now include a **30-second timeout fallback** to prevent hanging:

- **Normal Operation**: Scripts typically complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Safety Net**: 30-second timeout ensures scripts never hang indefinitely
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Prevents AI agents from getting stuck waiting for script completion
- **Graceful Exit**: Scripts exit cleanly after server verification or timeout

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ‚ö° High-Performance UI

- **Lightning Fast Loading**: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Optimized Performance**: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Smooth Interactions**: All UI interactions are instant and responsive
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage with 13.8MB heap size
- **Accessibility First**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Natural Language Financial Queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
