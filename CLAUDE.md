# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides conversational responses to user queries and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

## Recent Updates

The project has been recently updated to consolidate migration documentation into a single comprehensive guide. See `/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete migration instructions.
