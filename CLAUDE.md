## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->
[CLEANUP] Complete removal of legacy Polygon MCP Tools and server infrastructure

- Removed 6 legacy Polygon MCP tools completely from codebase
- Deleted MCP server infrastructure (mcp_service.py, dependency injection, lifecycle management)
- Updated AI agent instructions to reference only 12 direct API tools (was 18)
- Cleaned up all code, documentation, and Serena memories
- Final tool count: 12 (1 Finnhub + 11 Polygon Direct API)
- All 16/16 tests passing with direct API tools only
- Pylint score: 10.00/10 for all modified files

Migration Complete - Tool Evolution:
‚úÖ **Phase 1** (Commit fe380fa): Migrated 6 MCP tools ‚Üí 5 direct API tools
‚úÖ **Phase 2** (This commit): Removed all legacy MCP infrastructure and references

Code Cleanup (8 files modified, 1 deleted):
- ‚ùå Deleted: src/backend/services/mcp_service.py (entire file)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/services/__init__.py (removed MCP exports)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/services/agent_service.py (removed MCP parameter, updated instructions)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/dependencies.py (removed MCP server dependency injection)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/main.py (removed MCP server lifecycle)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/routers/chat.py (removed MCP server usage)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/cli.py (removed MCP server creation)
- ‚úÖ Updated: src/backend/__init__.py (removed MCP exports)

AI Agent Instructions Updated:
- Tool count: 18 ‚Üí 12 (removed 6 MCP tools)
- Removed all references to: get_snapshot_all, get_snapshot_option, list_aggs, get_daily_open_close_agg, get_previous_close_agg, get_aggs
- Simplified instructions to focus on direct API tools only
- Updated tool descriptions to remove "replaces MCP" language

Final Tool Count: **12 tools total**
- **1 Finnhub tool:** get_stock_quote
- **11 Polygon Direct API tools:** get_market_status_and_date_time, get_stock_quote_multi, get_options_quote_single, get_OHLC_bars_custom_date_range, get_OHLC_bars_specific_date, get_OHLC_bars_previous_close, get_ta_sma, get_ta_ema, get_ta_rsi, get_ta_macd

BREAKING CHANGE: Removed Polygon MCP server and all MCP-based tools. All financial queries now use direct Polygon Python API with no MCP overhead.

## üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

üî¥ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TESTING CHECKPOINT

**Testing is NOT optional - it is REQUIRED for task completion:**

### **Testing Workflow (MUST FOLLOW):**

1. **Code Implementation** ‚Üí Create/update code
2. **Test Suite Update** ‚Üí Create/update test files
3. **üî¥ TEST EXECUTION (MANDATORY)** ‚Üí RUN the test suite
4. **Test Verification** ‚Üí Verify 100% pass rate
5. **Documentation** ‚Üí Update docs with test results

### **Test Execution Requirements:**

‚úÖ **MUST DO:**
- Execute test suite (e.g., `./test_16_prompts_persistent_session.sh`)
- Show test results to user (pass/fail counts, response times)
- Verify 100% success rate
- Provide test report file path
- Fix any failures and re-test

‚ùå **NEVER DO:**
- Skip test execution
- Claim completion without test results
- Mark task "done" without test evidence
- Proceed to documentation without running tests

### **Enforcement Rules:**

üî¥ **Code without test execution = Code NOT implemented**
üî¥ **No test results = Task INCOMPLETE**
üî¥ **Test results are PROOF of implementation**
üî¥ **Tests must run BEFORE documentation updates**

### **Pattern Recognition:**

**WRONG (What NOT to do):**
```
1. Create 5 new tools ‚úÖ
2. Update test suite file ‚úÖ
3. Update documentation ‚úÖ
4. Mark task complete ‚ùå (NEVER ran tests!)
```

**CORRECT (What TO do):**
```
1. Create 5 new tools ‚úÖ
2. Update test suite file ‚úÖ
3. RUN test suite: ./test_16_prompts_persistent_session.sh ‚úÖ
4. Show results: 16/16 PASS, 100% success ‚úÖ
5. Provide test report path ‚úÖ
6. Update documentation with test results ‚úÖ
7. Mark task complete ‚úÖ
```

### **When to Run Tests:**

- After creating new tools/functions
- After modifying existing code
- After updating AI agent instructions
- After changing test suite
- Before updating documentation
- Before claiming task completion

**Remember: If you haven't RUN the tests and SHOWN the results, the task is NOT complete.**

## Quick Start

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (NOW WORKING - FIXED)
./start-app.sh  # ‚úÖ WORKING: Script now exits cleanly with timeout
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (NOW WORKING - FIXED)

- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Script now exits cleanly with timeout mechanism
- **Features**: 30-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging
- **Environment Support**: Works in both X11 and WSL2/headless environments
- **Background Mode**: Uses background processes in WSL2, terminal windows in X11
- **Logging**: Writes server logs to backend.log and frontend.log in WSL2 mode

## What the Scripts Do

### ‚è∞ Timeout Mechanism

Both scripts now include a **30-second timeout fallback** to prevent hanging:

- **Normal Operation**: Scripts typically complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Safety Net**: 30-second timeout ensures scripts never hang indefinitely
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Prevents AI agents from getting stuck waiting for script completion
- **Graceful Exit**: Scripts exit cleanly after server verification or timeout

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ‚ö° High-Performance UI

- **Lightning Fast Loading**: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Optimized Performance**: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Smooth Interactions**: All UI interactions are instant and responsive
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage with 13.8MB heap size
- **Accessibility First**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Natural Language Financial Queries

Ask questions like:

## Example Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
2. Type your financial query
3. Get instant structured responses with sentiment analysis

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9 and Polygon.io MCP integration v0.4.1
- **Frontend**: React 18.2+ with Vite 5.2+ and TypeScript
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E test suite
- **Deployment**: Fixed ports (8000/3000/5500) with one-click startup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
