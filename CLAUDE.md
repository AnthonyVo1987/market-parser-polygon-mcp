# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides conversational responses to user queries and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

## Recent Updates

The project has been recently updated to consolidate migration documentation into a single comprehensive guide. See `/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete migration instructions.

## Prototyping Principles (ENFORCED)

**CRITICAL PROJECT STAGE NOTICE:** This project is currently in the prototyping stage. All development work must adhere to the following principles:

### Core Prototyping Requirements

- **Do NOT over-engineer ANYTHING** - Focus on functional prototypes, not perfect solutions
- **Prioritize functionality over optimization** - Get features working before making them efficient
- **Maintain prototype simplicity** - Avoid complex architectural patterns unless absolutely necessary

### NOT REQUIRED for Prototyping Stage

- **Enterprise Grade solutions** - Simple, functional implementations are preferred
- **Production Ready implementations** - Focus on demonstrating functionality
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimize only if performance blocks functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Basic functional validation is sufficient
- **Test Scripts or Unit Tests** - Manual testing is acceptable for prototyping
- **CI/CD Pipeline implementation** - Basic git workflows are sufficient

### Prototyping Development Guidelines

- **Rapid iteration over perfect implementation** - Build, test, learn, iterate
- **Functional completeness over code quality** - Make it work first, refine later
- **Future scalability awareness without over-engineering** - Consider future needs but don't implement them yet
- **Documentation focused on usage, not internal architecture** - Help users understand what it does, not how it works internally

All specialists and development work must respect these prototyping constraints to maintain project momentum and avoid premature optimization.

## /new_task Workflow (Enhanced A-I Process)

**UPDATED WORKFLOW:** The `/new_task` command follows a systematic A-I process with tech-lead orchestration for all modes.

### Core Workflow Steps

**A. User Invokes `/new_task`**
- User provides task details via `/new_task` command
- Task details captured for analysis and planning

**B. Tech-Lead Orchestrator Analysis (ALWAYS REQUIRED)**
- Main Agent MUST use `@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator` regardless of Plan Mode or Non-Plan Mode
- Tech-lead reads, analyzes, and reviews task details in `new_task_details.md`
- Systematic evaluation of requirements and constraints

**C. Plan Mode: Tech-Lead Orchestrated Planning**
- `@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator` generates comprehensive plan WITH Specialist Assignments
- Detailed task breakdown with specialist role allocations
- Resource requirements and dependency mapping

**D. Non-Plan Mode: Tech-Lead Orchestrated Planning**
- `@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator` generates streamlined plan WITH Specialist Assignments
- Focused task execution plan with specialist coordination
- Efficient resource allocation for immediate implementation

**E. Specialist Execution**
- Specialists execute plan from `@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator`
- ALL specialists MUST use MCP tools as primary method:
  - `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
  - `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for research
  - `mcp__filesystem__*` for all file operations
- Prototyping principles enforced throughout execution

**F. Documentation Updates (Post-Execution)**
- Generate detailed Last Completed Task Summary ‚Üí overwrite `LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md`
- Generate high-level 20-line summary ‚Üí update CLAUDE.md task summary section
- Ensure comprehensive documentation of all changes and outcomes

**G. Primary GitHub Tools Usage**
- PRIMARY: `mcp__github__push_files` for all atomic commit operations
- Secondary: Traditional git commands only when GitHub MCP tools insufficient
- Must justify fallback to traditional git commands

**H. Atomic Commit Execution**
- Single atomic commit containing ALL changes:
  - Code/file changes
  - Documentation updates
  - CLAUDE.md updates  
  - LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md updates
- No separation between code changes and documentation changes

**I. Single Commit Completion**
- All code, documentation, and task summary changes belong in same commit
- Comprehensive commit message documenting all changes
- Clean working tree with all changes properly versioned

### Workflow Enforcement

**Tech-Lead Orchestrator Requirements:**
- MANDATORY for both Plan Mode and Non-Plan Mode
