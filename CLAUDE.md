# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides dual-mode response processing (JSON for button clicks, conversational for user messages) and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

- Build with future scalability in mind but don't over-engineer

**2. Security & Quality Gates:**

- `@code-reviewer` MUST review all changes before merge for both Python and React code
- Security considerations for production-ready development
- Input validation and secure data handling across API boundaries
- Basic authentication and CORS handling for API access

**3. Backend Development Focus:**

- `@backend-developer` leads all Python backend changes
- Maintain dual-mode response processing architecture
- Preserve 5-state FSM simplicity and reliability
- Design backend APIs that are React frontend ready

**4. React Frontend Architecture:**
