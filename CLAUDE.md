# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides dual-mode response processing (JSON for button clicks, conversational for user messages) and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.
