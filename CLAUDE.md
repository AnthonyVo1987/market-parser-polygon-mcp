# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides conversational responses to user queries and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

## Recent Updates

## Prototyping Principles (ENFORCED)

**CRITICAL PROJECT STAGE NOTICE:** This project is currently in the prototyping stage. All development work must adhere to the following principles:

### Core Prototyping Requirements

- **Do NOT over-engineer ANYTHING** - Focus on functional prototypes, not perfect solutions
- **Prioritize functionality over optimization** - Get features working before making them efficient
- **Maintain prototype simplicity** - Avoid complex architectural patterns unless absolutely necessary

### NOT REQUIRED for Prototyping Stage

- **Enterprise Grade solutions** - Simple, functional implementations are preferred
- **Production Ready implementations** - Focus on demonstrating functionality
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimize only if performance blocks functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Basic functional validation is sufficient
- **Test Scripts or Unit Tests** - Manual testing is acceptable for prototyping
- **CI/CD Pipeline implementation** - Basic git workflows are sufficient

### Prototyping Development Guidelines

- **Rapid iteration over perfect implementation** - Build, test, learn, iterate
- **Functional completeness over code quality** - Make it work first, refine later
- **Future scalability awareness without over-engineering** - Consider future needs but don't implement them yet
- **Documentation focused on usage, not internal architecture** - Help users understand what it does, not how it works internally

All specialists and development work must respect these prototyping constraints to maintain project momentum and avoid premature optimization.

```

**Verify Frontend Configuration:**

```bash
# Check that frontend can reach backend API
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
# Should load the React application

# Verify API connection in browser console:
# Open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ → F12 Developer Tools → Console
# Should show no CORS or connection errors
```

**Access the GUI:** Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000/> in your browser

**Test the complete system:**

- CLI: Ask "tell me about NVDA stock" - should get emoji-enhanced financial analysis
- GUI: Open browser, type financial queries - should get same enhanced responses
- Both interfaces should show identical emoji-based sentiment indicators (📈📉💰)

### 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

**Backend Issues:**

- **Missing API keys**: Check .env file has both POLYGON_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- **Port 8000 busy**: Kill existing process with `lsof -i :8000` then `kill -9 <PID>`
- **uv not found**: Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Backend not responding**: Verify with `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

**Port Configuration Issues:**

```bash
# Check which process is using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
# Kill process if needed: kill -9 <PID>

# Restart with one-click startup
npm run start:app
```

**Static Configuration:**

**Backend Configuration (.env) - Required:**

- **POLYGON_API_KEY**: Your Polygon.io API key (required)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- **OPENAI_MODEL**: AI model to use (default: gpt-5-mini)
- **AGENT_SESSION_NAME**: SQLite session name (default: finance_conversation)
- **MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**: MCP server timeout (default: 120.0)

**Static Server Configuration:**

- **Backend**: Always runs on <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
- **Frontend Development**: Always runs on <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
- **Frontend Production**: Always runs on <http://127.0.0.1:5500>
- **No configuration needed** - ports are hard-coded for consistency

**Frontend Issues:**

- **npm install fails**: Update Node.js to 18+ and try again
- **Port 3000 busy**: Kill existing process with `lsof -i :3000` then `kill -9 <PID>`
- **CORS errors**: Ensure backend is running on 127.0.0.1:8000
- **API connection failed**: Check backend health endpoint

**API Issues:**

- **400 Bad Request**: Verify backend is running and API keys are valid
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Check backend logs for MCP server initialization errors
- **CORS errors**: Verify backend is running on 127.0.0.1:8000
- **MCP server errors**: Ensure uvx is in PATH and Polygon API key is correct
- **Connection timeout**: Increase MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in .env file

**Port Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check if frontend is accessible
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/

# List all listening ports
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
netstat -tlnp | grep :3000

# Test end-to-end API connection
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test"}'
```
