# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and React web application for natural
language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI
GPT-5-nano via the OpenAI Agents SDK v0.2.9.

## Quick Start

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
• TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```


# 🔴 CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

🔴 CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

## 🔴 MANDATORY: SYSTEMATIC TOOL USAGE ENFORCEMENT

**YOU MUST use Sequential-Thinking and Serena tools throughout ENTIRE implementation:**

- **START every phase** with Sequential-Thinking for systematic approach
- **Use Serena tools** for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern searches
- **Use Sequential-Thinking** repeatedly for complex reasoning and planning
- **Use Standard Read/Write/Edit** only when Serena doesn't support the specific operation
- **NEVER stop using advanced tools** until task completion

### Serena Tool Setup

Before using Serena tools for code analysis, get the initial instructions to understand optimal usage:

- **Primary Method (Preferred)**: Use `mcp__serena__initial_instructions` tool
- **Fallback Method**: If tool fails, use `mcp__serena__read_memory` with memory name: `serena_initial_instructions`

These instructions provide critical guidance on:

- Token-efficient code exploration using symbolic tools
- Proper file reading vs. full file scanning
- Symbol overview and targeted symbol reads
- Pattern searching for flexible searches

🔴 REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## 🔴 CRITICAL: MANDATORY TESTING CHECKPOINT

**Testing is NOT optional - it is REQUIRED for task completion:**

### **Testing Workflow (MUST FOLLOW):**

1. **Code Implementation** → Create/update code
2. **Test Suite Update** → Create/update test files
3. **🔴 TEST EXECUTION (MANDATORY)** → RUN the test suite
4. **Test Verification** → Verify 100% pass rate
5. **Documentation** → Update docs with test results

### **Test Execution Requirements:**

✅ **MUST DO:**

- Execute test suite (e.g., `chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh`)
- 🔴 MANDATORY - VERIFY THE CONTENT OF EACH TEST PROMPT RESPONSE THAT IT MATCHES THE EXPECTED RESPONSE, PROPER TOOL CALLS, AND RESPONSE FORMATTING 🔴
 - PASS CRITERIA: CONTENT OF TEST PROMPT RESPONS MATCHES THE EXPECTED RESPONSE, PROPER TOOL CALLS, AND RESPONSE FORMATTING
- Show test results to user (Reponse content pass/fail counts, response times)
- Verify 100% success rate
- Provide test report file path
- Fix any failures and re-test

❌ **NEVER DO:**

- Skip test execution
- Claim completion without test results
- Mark task "done" without test evidence
- Proceed to documentation without running tests

### **Enforcement Rules:**

🔴 **Code without test execution = Code NOT implemented**
🔴 **No test results = Task INCOMPLETE**
🔴 **Test results are PROOF of implementation**
🔴 **Tests must run BEFORE documentation updates**

### **Pattern Recognition:**

**WRONG (What NOT to do):**

```text
1. Create 5 new tools ✅
2. Update test suite file ✅
3. Update documentation ✅
4. Mark task complete ❌ (NEVER ran tests!)
```

**CORRECT (What TO do):**

```text
1. Create 5 new tools ✅
2. Update test suite file ✅
3. RUN test suite: chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh ✅
4. Show results: 16/16 PASS, 100% success ✅
5. Provide test report path ✅
6. Update documentation with test results ✅
7. Mark task complete ✅
```

### **When to Run Tests:**

- After creating new tools/functions
- After modifying existing code
- After updating AI agent instructions
- After changing test suite
- Before updating documentation
- Before claiming task completion

**Remember: If you haven't RUN the tests and SHOWN the results, the task is NOT complete.**

## 🔴 CRITICAL: PROPER ATOMIC COMMIT WORKFLOW

### MANDATORY: Stage ONLY Immediately Before Commit

#### The Fatal Mistake: Early Staging

**NEVER stage files early during development. Staging is the LAST step before committing.**

**What happens when you stage too early:**

1. ⏰ **Time T1**: You run `git add` (files staged)
   - Staging area = snapshot at T1
2. ⏰ **Time T2-T5**: You continue working
   - Update config files
   - Run tests (generates test reports)
   - Update documentation
3. ⏰ **Time T6**: You run `git commit`
   - **Only commits the T1 snapshot**
   - **All work after T1 is MISSING**

**Result: Incomplete, broken atomic commits** ❌

### Correct Atomic Commit Workflow

**Follow this workflow EXACTLY:**

1. **DO ALL WORK FIRST** (DO NOT stage anything yet):
   - ✅ Complete ALL code changes
   - ✅ Run ALL tests and generate test reports
   - ✅ Update ALL documentation (CLAUDE.md, tech_stack.md, etc.)
   - ✅ Update ALL config files (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
   - ✅ Update ALL Serena memories
   - ✅ Update ALL task plans
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT RUN `git add` YET**

2. **VERIFY EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Review ALL changed/new files
   git diff    # Review ALL changes
   ```

3. **STAGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE**:

   ```bash
   git add -A  # Stage ALL files in ONE command
   ```

   - ⚠️ This is the FIRST time you run `git add`

4. **VERIFY STAGING IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Verify ALL files staged, NOTHING unstaged
   ```

5. **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY** (within 60 seconds):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "message"
   ```

6. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### What Belongs in an Atomic Commit

**ALL of these must be included together:**

- ✅ Code changes (backend + frontend)
- ✅ Test reports (evidence of passing tests)
- ✅ Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
- ✅ Memory updates (.serena/memories/)
- ✅ Config changes (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
- ✅ Task plan updates (TODO_task_plan.md, etc.)

### ❌ NEVER DO THIS

- ❌ Stage files early during development
- ❌ Stage files "as you go"
- ❌ Run `git add` before ALL work is complete
- ❌ Delay between `git add` and `git commit`
- ❌ Commit without test reports
- ❌ Commit without documentation updates

**Reference:** See `.serena/memories/git_commit_workflow.md` for complete details.

**Enforcement:** Incomplete commits will be reverted and reworked.



**One-Click REACT GUI Application Backend & Frontend Server Startup Scripts:**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
chmod +x start-app-xterm.sh && ./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (NOW WORKING - FIXED)
chmod +x start-app.sh && ./start-app.sh
```

## What the Scripts Do

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

### ⏰ Timeout Mechanism

Both scripts now include a **30-second timeout fallback** to prevent hanging:

- **Normal Operation**: Scripts typically complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Safety Net**: 30-second timeout ensures scripts never hang indefinitely
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Prevents AI agents from getting stuck waiting for script completion
- **Graceful Exit**: Scripts exit cleanly after server verification or timeout

### 🔄 Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### 🚀 Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ✅ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### 🌐 Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### Natural Language Financial Queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits

## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->
[FIX] Options Chain Bid/Ask Display - RULE #9 Agent Instructions Update

**Problem:** Agent displaying single "Price (mid)" column instead of separate Bid and Ask columns
**Root Cause:** Backend functions WERE correct (returning bid/ask fields), but RULE #9 agent instructions specified single "price" column format
**Solution:** Updated RULE #9 to explicitly require both Bid and Ask columns, prohibit midpoint calculations

**Files Modified:**
- src/backend/services/agent_service.py (RULE #9, lines 256-272)
  - Changed "price" → "bid, ask" in response format description (line 257)
  - Added explicit warning "DO NOT calculate or show midpoint/average prices" (line 261)
  - Updated table format from single "Price" column to separate "Bid" and "Ask" columns (lines 263-265)
  - Added instruction "Show BOTH Bid and Ask columns" (line 268)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 44/44 tests PASSED (100% success rate)
- ✅ 12.95s average response time (EXCELLENT rating)
- ✅ All options chain tests (17, 18, 36, 37) show separate Bid/Ask columns
- ✅ Test report: test-reports/test_cli_regression_loop1_2025-10-10_22-58.log

**Documentation Updates:**
- .serena/memories/tech_stack.md - Added Bid/Ask display fix section (45 lines)
- CLAUDE.md - Updated last completed task summary with comprehensive fix details

**Verification:**
Quick manual tests confirmed SPY call/put options show "Bid    Ask" columns (NOT "Price (mid)")
Full CLI regression suite validated all 44 tests passing with correct Bid/Ask display

**Key Fix:**
Backend was ALREADY correct - issue was purely in AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (RULE #9)
Updating RULE #9 fixed display without any backend code changes
Lesson: Always verify actual output matches requirements
