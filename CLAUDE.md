# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Market Parser is a Python CLI and web GUI application for natural language financial queries using the Polygon.io MCP server and OpenAI's gpt-5-mini via the Pydantic AI Agent Framework. The application provides dual-mode response processing (JSON for button clicks, conversational for user messages) and is being expanded with a React frontend to supplement the current Gradio interface.

**2. Security & Quality Gates:**

- `@code-reviewer` MUST review all changes before merge for both Python and React code
- Security considerations for production-ready development
- Input validation and secure data handling across API boundaries
- Basic authentication and CORS handling for API access

**3. Backend Development Focus:**

- `@backend-developer` leads all Python backend changes
- Maintain dual-mode response processing architecture
- Preserve 5-state FSM simplicity and reliability
- Design backend APIs that are React frontend ready

-  Token cost tracking fixed (proper PydanticAI usage capture)
-  Emoji formatting enhanced (mandatory emojis in all responses)
-  XSS protection implemented (content sanitization in exports)
-  Secure file operations (0o600 permissions for temp files)

### Security Requirements
- Never commit API keys (use .env file)
- All export functionality uses secure file operations
- Input validation via `src/security_utils.py`
- Sensitive data automatically redacted in logs

### Testing Best Practices
- All new features require test coverage
- Performance tests validate 35% cost reduction target
- Integration tests confirm end-to-end workflows
- FSM tests ensure state transition integrity

# Core modules
from src.response_manager import ResponseManager, ProcessingMode
from src.response_parser import ResponseParser
from src.prompt_templates import PromptTemplateManager

# FSM components
from stock_data_fsm.states import AppState, StateContext
from stock_data_fsm.manager import StateManager

# Security utilities

```

## System Configuration

**Agent System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert financial analyst. Note that when using Polygon tools, prices are already stock split adjusted. Use the latest data available. Always double check your math. For any questions about the current date, use the 'get_today_date' tool. For long or complex queries, break the query into logical subtasks and process each subtask in order.
```

**Default Model:** gpt-5-mini (override with OPENAI_MODEL env var)

**External Dependencies:**
- Polygon.io MCP server (requires `uvx` in PATH)
- OpenAI API for gpt-5-mini model
- Python 3.10+ with uv package manager
