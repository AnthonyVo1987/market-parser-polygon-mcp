## Last Completed Task Summary

<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->
[TESTING] Add automated loop support to CLI_test_regression.sh

- Enhanced CLI_test_regression.sh with automated loop testing (1-10 iterations)
- Deleted legacy test_16_prompts_persistent_session.sh
- **Loop Parameter Support**: `./CLI_test_regression.sh [LOOP_COUNT]` (default: 1, max: 10)
- **Aggregate Statistics**: Min/max/avg response times across all loop iterations
- **Individual Reports**: Separate timestamped report per loop iteration

**Loop Enhancement Features:**

1. **Parameter Validation**: Enforces 1-10 loop range with clear error messages
2. **Per-Loop Tracking**: Each loop runs all 27 tests in single persistent session
3. **Aggregate Analysis**: Overall statistics calculated across all loops
4. **Report Generation**: Unique timestamped reports per loop iteration
5. **Loop Progress**: Visual indicators showing current loop (e.g., "LOOP 2/3")

**Test Results (1x and 3x Loop Validation):**

**1-Loop Test (Baseline):**

- Total Tests: 27/27 PASSED
- Avg Response Time: 6.44s
- Performance: EXCELLENT

## 🔴 CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

🔴 CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

🔴 REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. 🔴 NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

🔴 REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## 🔴 CRITICAL: MANDATORY TESTING CHECKPOINT

**Testing is NOT optional - it is REQUIRED for task completion:**

### **Testing Workflow (MUST FOLLOW):**

1. **Code Implementation** → Create/update code
2. **Test Suite Update** → Create/update test files
3. **🔴 TEST EXECUTION (MANDATORY)** → RUN the test suite
4. **Test Verification** → Verify 100% pass rate
5. **Documentation** → Update docs with test results

### **Test Execution Requirements:**

✅ **MUST DO:**

- Execute test suite (e.g., `./test_16_prompts_persistent_session.sh`)
- Show test results to user (pass/fail counts, response times)
- Verify 100% success rate
- Provide test report file path
- Fix any failures and re-test

❌ **NEVER DO:**

- Skip test execution
- Claim completion without test results
- Mark task "done" without test evidence
- Proceed to documentation without running tests

### **Enforcement Rules:**

🔴 **Code without test execution = Code NOT implemented**
🔴 **No test results = Task INCOMPLETE**
🔴 **Test results are PROOF of implementation**
🔴 **Tests must run BEFORE documentation updates**

### **Pattern Recognition:**

**WRONG (What NOT to do):**

```text
1. Create 5 new tools ✅
2. Update test suite file ✅
3. Update documentation ✅
4. Mark task complete ❌ (NEVER ran tests!)
```

**CORRECT (What TO do):**

```text
1. Create 5 new tools ✅
2. Update test suite file ✅
3. RUN test suite: ./test_16_prompts_persistent_session.sh ✅
4. Show results: 16/16 PASS, 100% success ✅
5. Provide test report path ✅
6. Update documentation with test results ✅
7. Mark task complete ✅
```

### **When to Run Tests:**

- After creating new tools/functions
- After modifying existing code
- After updating AI agent instructions
- After changing test suite
- Before updating documentation
- Before claiming task completion

**Remember: If you haven't RUN the tests and SHOWN the results, the task is NOT complete.**

## Quick Start

### CLI Interface

```bash
uv run src/backend/main.py

> Tesla stock analysis
KEY TAKEAWAYS
• TSLA showing bullish momentum...
```

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically START all development servers BUT **DOES
NOT OPEN THE APP IN BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY**.

```bash
# Option 1: XTerm startup script (RECOMMENDED - WORKING)
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 2: Main startup script (NOW WORKING - FIXED)
./start-app.sh  # ✅ WORKING: Script now exits cleanly with timeout
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (NOW WORKING - FIXED)

- **Status**: ✅ WORKING - Script now exits cleanly with timeout mechanism
- **Features**: 30-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging
- **Environment Support**: Works in both X11 and WSL2/headless environments
- **Background Mode**: Uses background processes in WSL2, terminal windows in X11
- **Logging**: Writes server logs to backend.log and frontend.log in WSL2 mode

## What the Scripts Do

### ⏰ Timeout Mechanism

Both scripts now include a **30-second timeout fallback** to prevent hanging:

- **Normal Operation**: Scripts typically complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Safety Net**: 30-second timeout ensures scripts never hang indefinitely
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Prevents AI agents from getting stuck waiting for script completion
- **Graceful Exit**: Scripts exit cleanly after server verification or timeout

### 🔄 Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### 🚀 Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent hard-coded ports (no dynamic allocation)

### ✅ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### 🌐 Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Features

### ⚡ High-Performance UI

- **Lightning Fast Loading**: 85%+ improvement in Core Web Vitals
- **Optimized Performance**: 256ms First Contentful Paint (FCP)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
