## Migration Overview

### What This Guide Covers

This migration guide provides **functional prototype deployment** procedures for OpenAI-based financial analysis applications:

**Functional Prototype Extraction**
- Extract working applications from parent repositories
- Create independent, **functional** deployments
- Support for basic interfaces (CLI, FastAPI, React)
- Focus on **working functionality** rather than perfect architecture

### Deployment Method Selection

Choose based on your prototype needs:

**Method 1: Basic GitHub Setup (Recommended)**
- Simple repository creation
- Basic file copying
- Functional validation
- **Best for**: Quick functional prototypes

**Method 2: Local Manual Setup**  
- Direct file extraction
- Local testing validation
- No repository required
- **Best for**: Immediate functional testing

---

cp ../parent-repo/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/frontend_OpenAI/* ./frontend/
cp ../parent-repo/.env.example ./.env.example
```

**Environment Configuration (Basic)**
```bash
# Copy and configure basic environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add required API keys:
