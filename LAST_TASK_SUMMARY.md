# LAST TASK SUMMARY

## Task Completed: AI Team Configuration Optimization & Legacy Agent Cleanup
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Primary Agent:** Main Agent (Manual Analysis + Documentation Updates)  

### Task Overview
Completed comprehensive AI team configuration optimization to align with current tech stack, removing unused legacy framework agents and adding specialized coordination rules for Playwright testing and dynamic port handling. Enhanced project documentation organization by restructuring CLAUDE.md and updating /resync command protocols.

### Key Deliverables

#### 1. AI Team Configuration Optimization
**Location:** `/home/1000211866/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/CLAUDE.md` (AI Team Configuration section)

**Tech Stack Accurately Updated:**
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI + Python 3.10+ + Pydantic AI Agent Framework + OpenAI GPT-5-mini
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.2+ + Vite 5.2+ (corrected from outdated Next.js references)
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright CLI + MCP browser automation with B001-B016 test suite
- **Environment Management**: Dynamic port handling with .env configuration support

**Agent Task Assignments Optimized:**
- `@backend-developer` → FastAPI/OpenAI Agents SDK/MCP integration leadership
- `@react-component-architect` → React/Vite frontend with responsive design focus
- `@api-architect` → FastAPI-React API contracts with dynamic port handling
- `@code-reviewer` → Quality assurance for FastAPI and React/TypeScript code
- `@documentation-specialist` → Playwright testing documentation and procedures
- `@code-archaeologist` → System analysis and architectural decisions

#### 2. Legacy Framework Agent Removal
**Agents Successfully Removed:**
- ✅ Django specialists: `django-api-developer.md`, `django-backend-expert.md`, `django-orm-expert.md`
- ✅ Laravel specialists: `laravel-backend-expert.md`, `laravel-eloquent-expert.md`  
- ✅ Rails specialists: `rails-activerecord-expert.md`, `rails-api-developer.md`, `rails-backend-expert.md`
- ✅ Vue specialists: `vue-component-architect.md`, `vue-nuxt-expert.md`, `vue-state-manager.md`
- ✅ Legacy enforcement test prompt: `.claude/tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md`

**Total Files Removed:** 28 files (including Zone.Identifier duplicates)

#### 3. New Coordination Rules Added

**6. Playwright Testing & Quality Assurance:**
- All testing must follow PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md specifications
- Support both Playwright CLI method (`npx playwright test`) and MCP browser automation
- Single browser session protocol for all test sequences (B001-B016)
- `@code-reviewer` validates test implementation and reports
- `@documentation-specialist` maintains test documentation and procedures

**7. Dynamic Port Management:**
- Backend: Default FastAPI port 8000, configurable via FASTAPI_PORT environment variable
- Frontend: Default Vite dev server port 3000, auto-detection of next available port
- Handle port conflicts with clear error messages and alternative configurations
- Environment-specific configuration support (.env files for different deployment modes)

#### 4. Documentation Structure Optimization
**CLAUDE.md Restructured:**
- **Moved Project Overview to top** for immediate context
- **Enhanced Last Completed Task Summary** with better formatting and visibility
- **Consolidated AI Team Configuration** with current tech stack alignment
- **Streamlined Quick Start Guide** with clear command sequences

**Updated /resync Command:**
- **Removed MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md reference** (document no longer exists)
- **Enhanced MCP Tools priority guidance** with clearer fallback hierarchy
- **Simplified documentation reading sequence** for faster context loading

#### 5. MCP Tool Integration Updates
**Frontend-Specific MCP Usage Updated:**
- React agents MUST fetch latest **React and Vite** documentation using context7 (updated from Next.js)
- Always verify current React patterns and Vite build optimization before implementation
- Use context7 for TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier best practices

**Development Workflow Enhanced:**
- **Playwright Testing Workflow** added with complete B001-B016 test suite support
- **Single browser session protocol** enforcement for all test sequences
- **Dual testing methodology** support (CLI and MCP browser automation)

### Technical Implementation

#### Complete Legacy Framework Cleanup
**Files Deleted (28 total):**
```
.claude/agents/specialized/django/ (6 files + duplicates)
.claude/agents/specialized/laravel/ (4 files + duplicates)  
.claude/agents/specialized/rails/ (6 files + duplicates)
.claude/agents/specialized/vue/ (6 files + duplicates)
.claude/tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md
```

#### Configuration Alignment Corrections
**Previous Inconsistencies Fixed:**
- ❌ **Backend Framework**: Listed as "Python 3.10+ with Pydantic AI Agent Framework" (incomplete)
- ✅ **Corrected**: "FastAPI with Python 3.10+ and Pydantic AI Agent Framework" (complete stack)
- ❌ **Frontend Framework**: "Next.js 14+ with App Router (to supplement/replace Gradio)" (outdated plan)
- ✅ **Corrected**: "React 18.2+ with Vite 5.2+ build system" (current implementation)
- ❌ **Testing**: "pytest with async support" (incomplete)
- ✅ **Enhanced**: "pytest with async support + Playwright for E2E testing" (complete coverage)

#### Enhanced Coordination Rules
**New Specialized Rules Added:**
1. **Playwright Testing & Quality Assurance** - Complete B001-B016 test suite coordination
2. **Dynamic Port Management** - Backend/frontend port conflict resolution
3. **Updated React/Vite Architecture** - Modern build system integration
4. **Enhanced MCP Tool Requirements** - Context7 integration for React/Vite documentation

### Quality Assurance
