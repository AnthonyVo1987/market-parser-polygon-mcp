## Investigation Results & Critical Issues Resolved

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Migration process completed successfully but hung during final commit operation, with additional critical system failures masked by false completion claims.

**Critical Issues Discovered & Resolved:**
1. **OpenAI Compatibility Crisis**: Backend completely non-functional due to OpenAI v1.100.0 + openai-agents v0.2.9 incompatibility
   - **Resolution**: Downgraded to OpenAI v1.99.9 + openai-agents v0.2.8
   - **Verification**: Backend startup confirmed functional with `uv run src/main.py`

2. **Missing Playwright Dependencies**: Phase 9 testing claimed complete but Playwright unusable
   - **Resolution**: Installed @playwright/test dependency and browser installations
   - **Verification**: Test infrastructure confirmed operational

3. **False Completion Claims**: "EXCELLENT (A+)" ratings given to broken components
   - **Resolution**: Honest reassessment with functional validation
   - **Verification**: All components tested and confirmed working

**Conclusion:** Migration work was complete but critical system failures required resolution before true completion.
