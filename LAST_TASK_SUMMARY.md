## Task 1: Enhanced 10-Phase Migration Plan Code Review ‚úÖ

### Review Methodology
- Used `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Applied code-reviewer standards per CLAUDE.md specifications
- Validated specialist feedback implementation and prototyping compliance

### Document Reviewed
**Target Document:** `docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Size**: 457 lines, comprehensive migration orchestration guide
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for migration execution
- **Scope**: 10-phase sequential migration with specialist coordination

### Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

**üî¥ Critical Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ‚ùå Inconsistent specialist assignments between summary table and individual phases
- ‚ùå Validation conflicts where validator and assignee were same person  
- ‚ùå Single source of truth violations due to contradictory information

**üü° Major Issues (RESOLVED):**
- ‚ùå Performance metrics violating prototyping principles (removed)
- ‚ùå Complex validation scripts inappropriate for prototype stage (simplified)

**‚úÖ Applied Fixes:**
- Fixed specialist assignment table to match individual phase assignments
- Reassigned validators to eliminate conflicts  
- Simplified complex Python scripts to basic bash commands
- Removed over-engineered performance metrics
- Maintained prototyping simplicity throughout

### Review Outcome
- **Status**: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT - All critical issues resolved
- **Prototyping Compliance**: ‚úÖ VALIDATED - Document respects "no over-engineering" principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Serves as authoritative migration guide
- **Resource Assignments**: ‚úÖ CORRECTED - All specialist assignments now consistent
