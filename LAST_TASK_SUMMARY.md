## Critical Issues Discovered & Analyzed

### 1. Backend Agent Integration Failure (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Issue:** FastAPI backend returning 500 Internal Server Error with "Agent error:" message  
**Impact:** Complete inability to process financial analysis requests via both CLI and MCP methods  
**Evidence:** Direct API testing confirms agent communication breakdown  
**Diagnosis:** OpenAI agents framework or MCP server integration failure  
**Status:** Affects entire system functionality - both testing methodologies blocked

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Health endpoint (/health) working correctly - core FastAPI server operational
- Chat endpoint (/chat) failing with agent communication errors
- Suggests OpenAI agents v0.2.8 or MCP server integration problems
- API key authentication or agent initialization issues possible

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Debug OpenAI agents framework initialization process
2. Verify OpenAI API key authentication and quota status
3. Test Polygon.io MCP server connectivity independently
4. Validate dependency compatibility (OpenAI v1.99.9 + openai-agents v0.2.8)

### 2. CLI Configuration Validation Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Test configuration expecting 30000ms polling intervals vs actual 100ms Playwright internal polling  
**Impact:** Configuration validation failures across all tests despite functional success  
**Evidence:** All CLI tests show configuration mismatches but functional processing works  
**Status:** Testing framework ready, configuration expectations need alignment

**Resolution Required:**
- Update test configuration to align with Playwright's actual internal polling mechanism  
- Maintain 120s timeout configuration (working correctly)
- Remove false-positive configuration validation failures

### 3. Ticker Input Preservation Problems (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Button template system not preserving user ticker input correctly  
**Example:** User enters NVDA ‚Üí System analyzes AAPL (default ticker)  
**Impact:** Button functionality works but ticker specificity fails  
**Evidence:** B007, B009, B010 tests showing ticker validation failures  
**Status:** Template generation successful, ticker variable passing failing

**Resolution Required:**
- Debug ticker variable passing through button template system
- Ensure user ticker input properly preserved in analysis requests
- Test NVDA input resulting in NVDA analysis (not default AAPL)

### 4. Multi-Ticker Processing Limitations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  

**Issue:** Multi-ticker requests not processing all requested symbols  
**Example:** Request for NVDA, SPY, QQQ, IWM ‚Üí Only 2 tickers processed  
**Impact:** Complex analysis incomplete but basic functionality working  
**Evidence:** B005 test showing incomplete ticker coverage  
**Status:** Single ticker analysis working, multi-ticker needs optimization
