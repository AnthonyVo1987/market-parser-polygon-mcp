- **Size:** 390+ lines of targeted documentation
- **Focus:** AI agent-specific usage patterns for complex problem-solving in Market Parser development workflows

### ✅ **Complete Tool Parameter Coverage**
**Required Parameters:**
- `thought` - Current reasoning step with Market Parser context
- `nextThoughtNeeded` - Boolean continuation indicator
- `thoughtNumber` - Sequential step tracking (1-based)
- `totalThoughts` - Estimated analysis depth (prototype limit: 8)

**Optional Parameters:**

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Usage Scenario Coverage (7 Categories)**
1. **Complex Backend API Integration** - Polygon.io endpoints, MCP server connectivity
2. **Multi-Component Frontend Development** - React components with emoji sentiment indicators
3. **Full-Stack Feature Implementation** - End-to-end financial analysis features
4. **Architecture Decisions** - FastAPI routes, React component refactoring
5. **Bug Investigation** - Cross-stack issues requiring systematic analysis
6. **Test Automation and Validation** - Playwright B001-B016 test suite implementation
7. **Real-Time Data Integration** - WebSocket streaming, MCP timeout handling

### **Comprehensive Examples (8 Correct + 6 Incorrect)**
**Correct Usage Examples:**
- Complex Backend Feature (real-time stock alerts with WebSocket analysis)
- Frontend Component Architecture (financial chart component with state management)
- Cross-Stack Performance Issue (systematic debugging across FastAPI + React)
- Thought Revision (performance analysis correction with evidence-based pivoting)
- Branch Exploration (alternative component approach with financial-data specialization)
- Playwright Test Implementation (B001-B016 test suite systematic planning)
- WebSocket Integration Planning (real-time market data streaming architecture)
- Market Parser Emoji Sentiment Enhancement (cross-stack emoji integration planning)

**Incorrect Usage Anti-Patterns:**
- Simple task over-engineering (package.json reading)
- Vague thinking without specificity
- Single-step decisions not requiring analysis
- Emergency fixes requiring immediate action
- Over-analysis violating prototyping principles
- Missing Market Parser context (generic feature requests)

### **Tool Chain Integration (9 Complete Workflows)**
- Backend API Development → OpenAI Agents SDK integration
- Frontend Component Creation → React/Vite optimization
- Full-Stack Feature Implementation → End-to-end emoji sentiment analysis
- Performance Investigation → Systematic bottleneck diagnosis
- Bug Resolution → Cross-stack integration failure analysis
- Test Automation Development → Playwright comprehensive testing
- Documentation Creation → API documentation workflows
- Real-Time Feature Implementation → WebSocket-based live market data
- Migration and Refactoring → Major architectural changes

## Second Sanity Check Review Results

### **5 Critical Issues Identified & Fixed:**

#### ✅ **Issue 1: Tech Stack Inconsistencies**
- **Problem:** Documentation referenced "Pydantic AI Agent Framework" instead of actual "OpenAI Agents SDK"
- **Solution:** Updated application context and tool chain references to reflect actual codebase implementation
- **Impact:** Ensures AI agents reference correct documentation and frameworks

#### ✅ **Issue 2: Missing Critical Use Cases**
- **Problem:** No coverage of Playwright testing scenarios or WebSocket real-time data scenarios
- **Solution:** Added Test Automation section and Real-Time Data Integration scenarios with detailed examples
- **Impact:** Complete coverage of Market Parser development workflows

#### ✅ **Issue 3: Incomplete Tool Chain Examples**
- **Problem:** Tool chains didn't reflect actual specialist agent workflows from CLAUDE.md
- **Solution:** Added 5 new comprehensive tool chain patterns with specific use cases
- **Impact:** Accurate workflow guidance using actual project specialist agents

#### ✅ **Issue 4: Parameter Behavior Clarification**
- **Problem:** Missing details about auto-triggering behavior and prototype stage limits
- **Solution:** Enhanced parameter documentation with tool behavior notes and prototype constraints
- **Impact:** Clear guidance on tool limits and automatic extension behavior

#### ✅ **Issue 5: Generic Context Examples**
- **Problem:** Examples lacked Market Parser financial application specificity
- **Solution:** Added Market Parser specific success patterns and emoji sentiment integration example
- **Impact:** All examples now directly relate to financial application development
