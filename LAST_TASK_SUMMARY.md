- **Real Test Implementations**: Cross-referenced with actual .spec.ts files in codebase
- **Performance Standards**: Based on successful test executions (78%+ pass rates)
- **Single Browser Session Protocol**: Continuous session methodology for realistic user simulation
- **Comprehensive Checklists**: Step-by-step procedures for both CLI and MCP testing approaches

#### 2. Documentation Structure
**Organized Sections:**
- **Overview**: Complete framework introduction with key features
- **Quick Start Guide**: Prerequisites and methodology selection
- **B001-B016 Specifications**: All real tests with accurate file references and purposes
- **CLI Methodology**: Complete execution patterns with checklists
- **MCP Methodology**: Full browser automation workflows
- **Performance Standards**: Success criteria and validation metrics
- **Test Report Format**: Standardized reporting procedures
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution procedures

### Critical Error Corrections

#### Previous Documentation Issues Resolved
1. **Fictional Test Creation**: Previous master plan contained completely fabricated tests
   - ‚ùå **False B001**: "System Startup and Health Verification" 
   - ‚úÖ **Real B001**: "Market Status Check" (test-b001-market-status.spec.ts)
   
2. **Non-existent Test Files**: Referenced imaginary test files
   - ‚ùå **False Reference**: `basic_button_tests_B001-B016.spec.js`
   - ‚úÖ **Real Files**: `test-b001-market-status.spec.ts` through `test-b016-button-integration.spec.ts`

3. **Made-up Functionality**: Created fictional test purposes
   - ‚ùå **False B002**: "Frontend Loading and Basic Functionality"
   - ‚úÖ **Real B002**: "NVDA Ticker Analysis" with comprehensive financial data

4. **Code Review Failure**: Previous specialist failed to validate content against actual codebase
   - ‚ùå **Superficial Review**: Only structure checked, no content validation
   - ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Validation**: All specifications cross-referenced with real implementations

### Technical Implementation

#### Real B001-B016 Test Coverage

**Market/Ticker Analysis Tests (B001-B006):**
- **B001**: Market Status Check - Validates market connectivity and API health
- **B002**: NVDA Ticker Analysis - Tests NVIDIA stock analysis with financial data
- **B003**: SPY Ticker Analysis - Validates S&P 500 ETF analysis  
- **B004**: GME Ticker Analysis - Tests GameStop stock analysis
- **B005**: Multi-Ticker Analysis - Validates complex multi-ticker comparisons
- **B006**: Empty Message Handling - Tests error handling for invalid input

**Button Template System Tests (B007-B016):**
- **B007**: Stock Snapshot Button (üìà) - Tests market snapshot functionality
- **B008**: Support/Resistance Button (üìä) - Tests technical analysis features
- **B009**: Technical Analysis Button (üîß) - Tests comprehensive indicator analysis
- **B010-B016**: Advanced button system testing (interaction, validation, error handling, performance, accessibility, UI consistency, integration)

#### Methodology Documentation

**CLI Method:**
- Sequential execution pattern using `npx playwright test [filename]` 
- Single browser session maintenance across all tests
- Performance targets: <45s for market tests, <60s for button tests
- Complete checklist format for systematic execution

**MCP Method:**
- MCP browser tool integration (navigate, snapshot, type, click, wait_for)
- Same single browser session protocol
- Step-by-step procedures for each test using MCP automation
- Network monitoring and validation workflows

### Quality Assurance

#### Validation Process
1. **Test File Verification**: Confirmed all 16 .spec.ts files exist and match specifications
2. **Content Accuracy**: Cross-referenced all test descriptions with actual implementations
3. **Report Analysis**: Based specifications on successful CLI and MCP test reports
4. **Performance Data**: Used real timing data from successful test executions
5. **Methodology Validation**: Confirmed both CLI and MCP approaches work as documented

#### Documentation Standards
- **Accurate Specifications**: All test purposes match actual file implementations
- **Executable Procedures**: All documented steps can be followed exactly as written
- **Real Performance Data**: Timing expectations based on actual test results
- **Complete Coverage**: No fictional or non-existent tests included
- **Cross-Referenced Content**: All claims verified against actual codebase

### Project Context Integration

#### Market Parser Application Testing
