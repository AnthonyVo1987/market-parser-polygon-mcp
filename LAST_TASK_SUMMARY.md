```

**Failed/Incomplete Tests (2/5):**
- **GME Analysis (P004)**: Timeout after 110+ seconds (performance bottleneck identified)
- **Multi-ticker Request (P005)**: Skipped due to GME blocking sequential processing

### 🔍 **Critical Technical Findings**

**System Strengths:**
- **Emoji Integration Excellence**: Comprehensive emoji usage (📈📉💰💸🏢📊🎯⚠️) across all successful responses
- **Consistent Performance**: 35-37s response times for NVDA/SPY with ±1.2s standard deviation
- **System Stability**: Zero crashes during extended processing, proper UI state management
- **Response Quality**: Professional "🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS" format with technical accuracy

**Performance Issues Identified:**
- **GME Ticker Bottleneck**: 3x normal processing time (110+s vs 35s baseline)
- **Analysis Button Instability**: "Failed to load analysis tools" requiring chat input fallback
- **Missing Timeout Architecture**: No system-level timeout handling for long requests
- **Sequential Processing Limitation**: Single failed request blocks subsequent operations

### 📊 **System Validation Results**

**Corrected Specifications Performance:**
- ✅ **"PRIORITY FAST REQUEST" Format**: Working effectively with 35-37s response times
- ✅ **Emoji Support**: Extensive financial emoji integration validated
- ✅ **Conversational Responses**: Professional yet accessible language maintained
- ✅ **Flexible Format Support**: System accepts and processes various response formats
- ✅ **Basic Functionality Validation**: No JSON-only enforcement remaining

**Framework Improvements Confirmed:**
- ✅ Removed `validateSchema()` methods - replaced with `validateBasicFunctionality()`
- ✅ Graceful JSON parsing - returns null instead of throwing errors
- ✅ Emoji encouragement throughout validation framework
- ✅ Priority prompt format properly implemented across all tests
