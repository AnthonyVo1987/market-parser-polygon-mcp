- Best practices: 30s polling, 120s timeout, "üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS" patterns
- Market Parser integration: Financial chat, emoji sentiment, export testing
- Reference: Comprehensive 744-line usage guide

#### 3. Filesystem MCP Tools (Lines 54-63)
**Content Focus:** Multi-file operations vs single-file standard tools
- Decision matrix: MCP for 3+ files, standard tools for single operations
- Key tools: read_multiple_files, list_directory, search_files
- Project paths: Restricted to Market Parser directory
- Reference: Detailed decision patterns guide

#### 4. Context7 MCP Tools (Lines 65-74)
**Content Focus:** Library research for Market Parser tech stack
- Sequential usage: resolve-library-id ‚Üí get-library-docs pattern
- Tech stack focus: React 18.2+, Vite 5.2+, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK
- Token allocation: 4000-8000 tokens for research efficiency
- Reference: Market Parser specific examples guide

#### 5. Sequential-Thinking MCP Tools (Lines 76-85)
**Content Focus:** Complex multi-step analysis for financial features
- Prototyping limit: Maximum 8 thoughts per analysis
- Use cases: Cross-stack debugging, architecture decisions, performance issues
- Parameters: Core required and advanced optional parameters
- Reference: Complex analysis patterns guide

### References Removed During Cleanup

#### 1. **MCP Tool Requirements Section** (Former lines 163-177)
- **Content Removed**: General MCP tool mandates for specialist agents
- **Replaced By**: Consolidated guidance with specific tool recommendations
- **Impact**: Eliminated redundant 15-line section

#### 2. **Frontend-specific MCP Usage** (Former subsection)
- **Content Removed**: React-specific MCP mandates scattered in workflow sections
- **Replaced By**: Integrated guidance within consolidated Context7 and Filesystem sections
- **Impact**: Streamlined frontend development workflow descriptions

### Quality Assurance Process

#### 1. Systematic Review Using Sequential-Thinking
**Method**: 5-step systematic analysis of consolidation completeness
**Verification**: Confirmed all requirements met with zero content loss
**Result**: High-quality implementation ready for production use

#### 2. Comprehensive Reference Cleanup Verification
**Method**: grep search for remaining `mcp__` patterns in CLAUDE.md
**Result**: Only 4 references found, all within new consolidated section
**Confirmation**: 100% successful removal of scattered references

#### 3. Content Preservation Validation
**Method**: Manual review of all non-MCP content in CLAUDE.md
**Result**: Zero changes to project overview, prototyping principles, architecture, etc.
**Confirmation**: All critical project information perfectly preserved
