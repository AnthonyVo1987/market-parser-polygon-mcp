--font-body: 'Inter', -apple-system, sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;

/* Fintech Color Psychology */
--accent-trust: #6366f1;        /* Primary fintech purple for trust */
--accent-success: #10b981;      /* Bullish/gains industry standard */
--accent-error: #ef4444;        /* Bearish/losses industry standard */

/* Glassmorphic Design System */
--glass-surface-3: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
--glass-blur-md: blur(8px);
--shadow-glow-trust: 0 0 20px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3);
