# üö® MCP Tool Enforcement Guide for Delegated AI Specialists

> **CRITICAL**: This document provides enforcement protocols and templates. **TEMPORARY WAIVER ACTIVE** for specialist agents - see updated enforcement policy below.

## üìã Overview

This enforcement guide addresses MCP tool enforcement protocols for AI specialists. **NOTE: Current policy includes a temporary waiver for specialist agents while maintaining full enforcement for Tech Lead Orchestrator.**

## üö® CURRENT ENFORCEMENT POLICY (Updated 2025-08-18)

### **TEMPORARY WAIVER FOR SPECIALIST AGENTS**

**SPECIALIST AGENTS (WAIVER ACTIVE):**
- ‚úÖ **MCP Tool Enforcement WAIVED**: All specialist agents are temporarily **NOT REQUIRED** to use MCP tools
- ‚úÖ **Standard Claude Tools ACCEPTABLE**: Read, Write, Edit, LS, Grep, Bash tools are sufficient
- ‚úÖ **Quality Standards MAINTAINED**: All other development protocols remain fully enforced
- ‚úÖ **Focus on Implementation**: Emphasis on high-quality deliverables using available tools

**TECH LEAD ORCHESTRATOR (FULL ENFORCEMENT CONTINUES):**
- ‚ùå **NO WAIVER GRANTED**: @tech-lead-orchestrator remains fully subject to ALL MCP tool requirements
- ‚ùå **Must Use MCP Tools**: All existing enforcement protocols remain active for orchestrator role
- ‚ùå **No Standard Tools**: Cannot use Read, Write, Edit, LS, Grep, Bash for orchestrator responsibilities

### **Rationale for Temporary Waiver**

**Technical Constraints Identified:**
- Sub-agent specialists currently cannot properly implement MCP tool calls due to system limitations
- Enforcement was preventing productive work completion
- Standard Claude tools provide adequate functionality for specialist implementation tasks

**Waiver Scope:**
- **APPLIES TO**: All specialist agents (`@code-reviewer`, `@backend-developer`, `@frontend-developer`, `@documentation-specialist`, `@performance-optimizer`, `@api-architect`, `@code-archaeologist`)
- **DOES NOT APPLY TO**: `@tech-lead-orchestrator` (remains fully subject to MCP enforcement)

**MANDATORY MCP TOOLS FOR @tech-lead-orchestrator:**
```markdown
## üö® MANDATORY MCP TOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR ORCHESTRATOR:
You MUST use these MCP tools (VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION):

You MUST provide explicit evidence of MCP tool usage:
1. Sequential thinking steps showing systematic approach
2. Context7 research findings with specific discoveries
3. Filesystem operations evidence with specific tool calls

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: @tech-lead-orchestrator using only standard Claude tools

2. **SPECIFY VIOLATIONS**: Clearly identify which MCP tools were missing
3. **PROVIDE TEMPLATE**: Give the orchestrator the exact MCP enforcement template
4. **RE-DELEGATE**: Use the mandatory delegation template for retry
5. **VERIFY COMPLIANCE**: Check all evidence requirements before acceptance

**Rejection Message Template for Orchestrator:**

```markdown
## üö® ORCHESTRATOR WORK REJECTED - MCP TOOL VIOLATION

Your work as @tech-lead-orchestrator has been rejected for failing to use mandatory MCP tools.

**VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED:**
- [ ] Missing mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking evidence
- [ ] Missing mcp__context7 research evidence  
- [ ] Missing mcp__filesystem tool evidence
- [ ] Used only standard Claude tools (NOT ALLOWED for orchestrator)

**REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTION:**
