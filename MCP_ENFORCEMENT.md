# üö® MCP Tool Enforcement Guide for Delegated AI Specialists

> **CRITICAL**: This document provides enforcement protocols and templates to ensure ALL delegated AI specialists use mandatory MCP tools according to their role requirements.

## üìã Overview

This enforcement guide addresses the critical issue where delegated AI specialists were using only standard Claude tools (Read, Write, Edit, LS, Grep, Bash) instead of the mandatory MCP tools required by their roles. This violation undermines the project's quality standards and must be prevented.

## üö® DELEGATION TEMPLATE WITH MCP ENFORCEMENT

### **Standard Delegation Template (MANDATORY)**

When delegating to ANY specialist, use this exact template structure:

```markdown

## üéØ EVIDENCE VALIDATION EXAMPLES

### **‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE Evidence Examples**

**Sequential Thinking Evidence:**
```
I used mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking to systematically analyze this task:

Thought 1: Analyzed current code structure and identified 3 main issues...
Thought 2: Researched best practices for addressing these patterns...
Thought 3: Planned implementation approach with risk mitigation...
Thought 4: Validated approach against project requirements...
```

**Context7 Research Evidence:**
```
I used mcp__context7__resolve-library-id to research "react" patterns:
- Resolved library ID: /facebook/react
- Used mcp__context7__get-library-docs with topic "hooks and concurrent features"
- Key findings: [specific patterns and best practices discovered]
- Applied findings to implementation: [how research informed the solution]
```

**Filesystem Evidence:**
```
Used MCP filesystem tools for efficient operations:
- mcp__filesystem__read_multiple_files: Examined /path/file1.py, /path/file2.py
- mcp__filesystem__directory_tree: Analyzed project structure
- mcp__filesystem__edit_file: Updated imports and configurations
```

### **‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE Evidence Examples**

**Missing MCP Tools:**
```
I used Read, Write, and Edit tools to review the code...
[VIOLATION: No MCP tools used]
```

**Vague Analysis:**
```
I analyzed the code and it looks good...
[VIOLATION: No systematic thinking evidence]
```

**No Research:**
```
I implemented the feature using standard patterns...
[VIOLATION: No Context7 research performed]
```

## üö® VIOLATION RESPONSE PROTOCOL

### **When MCP Tool Violations Occur:**

1. **IMMEDIATE REJECTION**: Stop the task and reject the work
2. **SPECIFY VIOLATIONS**: Clearly identify which MCP tools were missing
3. **PROVIDE TEMPLATE**: Give the specialist the exact MCP enforcement template
4. **RE-DELEGATE**: Use the mandatory delegation template for retry
5. **VERIFY COMPLIANCE**: Check all evidence requirements before acceptance

### **Rejection Message Template:**

```markdown
## üö® WORK REJECTED - MCP TOOL VIOLATION

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### **Quality Indicators for MCP Compliance:**

**‚úÖ COMPLIANT Specialist Response:**
- Uses all mandatory MCP tools for their role
- Provides specific evidence of tool usage
- Shows systematic thinking progression
- Documents research findings clearly
- Applies discovered patterns appropriately

**‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT Specialist Response:**
- Uses only standard Claude tools
- No systematic analysis evidence
- No research performed
- Vague or incomplete documentation
- No integration of best practices

## üîÑ CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### **Monitoring and Adjustment:**

1. **Track Compliance**: Monitor which specialists consistently use MCP tools
2. **Identify Patterns**: Note common violation types and adjust templates
3. **Update Documentation**: Refine enforcement based on observed issues
4. **Training Updates**: Improve delegation templates based on results

### **Template Evolution:**

This enforcement guide should be updated whenever:
- New MCP tools become available
- Specialist role requirements change
- Violation patterns emerge that need addressing
- Better enforcement strategies are discovered

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: This enforcement guide must be referenced and applied for EVERY specialist delegation to ensure quality standards are maintained and MCP tool violations are prevented.
