## üîß Tool 1: Context7 - Latest Documentation Research

### **Current Enforcement Status**

- **ALL AGENTS**: **REQUIRED** (Universal enforcement based on successful validation)
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All 26 specialists must use Context7 for research tasks

### **Purpose**

Context7 provides access to the most up-to-date documentation, best practices, and code examples for any library or framework. It's your primary tool for researching current development patterns.

### **When to Use (Orchestrator Only)**

- ‚úÖ Researching latest framework versions (React 18+, Vue 3+, Gradio 4+, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Finding current API syntax and best practices
- ‚úÖ Getting code examples for modern patterns
- ‚úÖ Understanding breaking changes between versions
- ‚úÖ Before orchestrating any complex development delegation

### **When NOT to Use**

- ‚ùå For general programming concepts (use standard knowledge)
- ‚ùå For project-specific code (use filesystem tools)
- ‚ùå For debugging existing code (use other analysis tools)

### **Proper Tool Call Syntax (ALL AGENTS)**

#### Step 1: Resolve Library ID

```javascript
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id
Parameters:
{
  "libraryName": "exact-library-name"  // e.g., "gradio", "react", "fastapi"
}
```

#### Step 2: Get Documentation

```javascript
mcp_context7_get-library-docs
Parameters:
{
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/org/project",     // From step 1 result
  "topic": "specific-topic",                          // Optional: focus area
  "tokens": 5000                                      // Optional: response size limit
}
```

### **Best Practices (ALL AGENTS)**

1. **Always resolve library ID first** - Don't guess the Context7 ID format
2. **Be specific with topics** - "async handling in gradio 4.0" vs just "gradio"
3. **Use appropriate token limits** - 5000-10000 for detailed research
4. **Document findings** - Save key patterns found for team reference

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (ALL AGENTS)**

‚ùå **Wrong**: Guessing library IDs

```javascript
// DON'T DO THIS
"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio/gradio"  // Wrong format
```

‚úÖ **Correct**: Always resolve first

```javascript
// Step 1: Resolve
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id({"libraryName": "gradio"})
// Result: "/gradio-app/gradio"

// Step 2: Use resolved ID
mcp_context7_get-library-docs({"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio-app/gradio"})
```

### **Supplementary Research Methods (ALL AGENTS)**

**IN ADDITION to mandatory MCP Context7 usage, agents may also:**

- Review existing project documentation and patterns
- Analyze current codebase implementation conventions
- Study framework usage examples in existing code
- Cross-reference MCP research with project-specific patterns
- **ENHANCED**: Focus on enhanced JSON architecture patterns
- **ENHANCED**: Study dual parser architecture and schema validation approaches

## üß† Tool 2: Sequential Thinking - Problem Decomposition

### **Current Enforcement Status for Sequential Thinking**

- **ALL AGENTS**: **REQUIRED** (Universal enforcement based on successful validation)
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All 26 specialists must use Sequential Thinking for complex analysis

### **Sequential Thinking Purpose**

Breaks down complex problems into manageable, step-by-step thought processes. Essential for planning, architecture decisions, and systematic problem-solving.

### **When to Use (Orchestrator Only)**

- ‚úÖ Planning complex delegation strategies
- ‚úÖ Orchestrating multi-component development tasks
- ‚úÖ Strategic architecture and design decisions
- ‚úÖ Complex team coordination analysis
- ‚úÖ Before delegating any non-trivial development work

### **When NOT to Use**

- ‚ùå Simple, single-step tasks that don't require systematic breakdown
- ‚ùå Routine operations with obvious solutions
- ‚ùå Tasks with clear, predetermined approaches

### **Proper Tool Call Syntax (ALL AGENTS)**

```javascript
mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking
Parameters:
{
  "thought": "Your current thinking step",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true/false,
  "thoughtNumber": 1,           // Current step number
  "totalThoughts": 5,           // Estimated total steps
  "isRevision": false,          // Optional: if revising previous thought
  "revisesThought": 2,          // Optional: which thought to revise
  "branchFromThought": 3,       // Optional: branching point
  "branchId": "alternative-a", // Optional: branch identifier
  "needsMoreThoughts": false    // Optional: if need to extend
}
```

### **Required Analysis Pattern for ALL AGENTS**

**When using Sequential Thinking, agents should follow this systematic approach:**

```markdown
## Sequential Thinking Analysis

- [Risk assessment and mitigation]
- [Enhanced JSON architecture compliance]

### Thought 4: Implementation Strategy
- [Specific technical approaches]
- [Testing and validation plan]
- [Rollback considerations]
- [Coordination with primary architects]

### Thought 5: Success Validation
- [Measurable success criteria]
- [Testing procedures]
- [Quality verification steps]
- [Enhanced architecture standards verification]
```

## üìÅ Tool 3: Filesystem - Efficient File Operations

### **Current Enforcement Status for Filesystem Tools**

- **ALL AGENTS**: **REQUIRED** (Universal enforcement based on successful validation)
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All 26 specialists must use MCP Filesystem tools

### **Filesystem Tool Purpose**

Provides comprehensive file system operations that are more efficient and reliable than terminal-based commands. Handles reading, writing, searching, and managing files and directories.

### **When to Use Filesystem Tools (ALL AGENTS)**

- ‚úÖ Reading multiple files for orchestration analysis
- ‚úÖ Searching for architectural patterns across codebase
- ‚úÖ Getting comprehensive file/directory information
- ‚úÖ Directory traversal for delegation planning
- ‚úÖ Any orchestration-related file system operation

### **When NOT to Use Filesystem Tools**

- ‚ùå When you need git operations (use terminal/git tools)
- ‚ùå When you need to run executables
- ‚ùå For operations outside allowed directories

### **Filesystem Operations & Syntax (ALL AGENTS)**

#### File Reading Operations

```javascript
// Read single file
mcp_filesystem_read_text_file
{
  "path": "/full/path/to/file.py",
  "head": 50,     // Optional: first N lines
  "tail": 50      // Optional: last N lines
}

// Read multiple files efficiently
mcp_filesystem_read_multiple_files  
{
  "paths": ["/path/file1.py", "/path/file2.py"]
}

// Get file metadata
mcp_filesystem_get_file_info
{
  "path": "/path/to/file.py"
}
```

### **Deprecated File Operations (NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE)**

**DEPRECATED - These tools are NO LONGER acceptable for MCP-capable tasks:**

- ~~Claude Read tool~~ - Use mcp__filesystem__read_text_file instead
- ~~Claude LS tool~~ - Use mcp__filesystem__list_directory instead
- ~~Claude Write tool~~ - Use mcp__filesystem__write_file instead
- ~~Claude Edit tool~~ - Use mcp__filesystem__edit_file instead
- ~~Claude Grep tool~~ - Use filesystem search or Context7 instead
- **ENHANCED**: All file operations must use MCP filesystem tools for consistency
- **ENHANCED**: Coordinate with primary architects for file structure decisions
