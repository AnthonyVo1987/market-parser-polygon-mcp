## üîß Tool 1: Context7 - Latest Documentation Research

### **Current Enforcement Status**

- **SPECIALIST AGENTS**: ~~NOT REQUIRED~~ (Waived under current policy)
- **TECH LEAD ORCHESTRATOR**: **REQUIRED** (Full enforcement continues)

### **Purpose**

Context7 provides access to the most up-to-date documentation, best practices, and code examples for any library or framework. It's your primary tool for researching current development patterns.

### **When to Use (Orchestrator Only)**

- ‚úÖ Researching latest framework versions (React 18+, Vue 3+, Gradio 4+, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Finding current API syntax and best practices
- ‚úÖ Getting code examples for modern patterns
- ‚úÖ Understanding breaking changes between versions
- ‚úÖ Before orchestrating any complex development delegation

### **When NOT to Use**

- ‚ùå For general programming concepts (use standard knowledge)
- ‚ùå For project-specific code (use filesystem tools)
- ‚ùå For debugging existing code (use other analysis tools)
- ‚ùå **SPECIALIST AGENTS: Not required under current waiver policy**

### **Proper Tool Call Syntax (Orchestrator Only)**

#### Step 1: Resolve Library ID

```javascript
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id
Parameters:
{
  "libraryName": "exact-library-name"  // e.g., "gradio", "react", "fastapi"
}
```

#### Step 2: Get Documentation

```javascript
mcp_context7_get-library-docs
Parameters:
{
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/org/project",     // From step 1 result
  "topic": "specific-topic",                          // Optional: focus area
  "tokens": 5000                                      // Optional: response size limit
}
```

### **Best Practices (Orchestrator Only)**

1. **Always resolve library ID first** - Don't guess the Context7 ID format
2. **Be specific with topics** - "async handling in gradio 4.0" vs just "gradio"
3. **Use appropriate token limits** - 5000-10000 for detailed research
4. **Document findings** - Save key patterns found for team reference

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (Orchestrator Only)**

‚ùå **Wrong**: Guessing library IDs

```javascript
// DON'T DO THIS
"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio/gradio"  // Wrong format
```

‚úÖ **Correct**: Always resolve first

```javascript
// Step 1: Resolve
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id({"libraryName": "gradio"})
// Result: "/gradio-app/gradio"

// Step 2: Use resolved ID
mcp_context7_get-library-docs({"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio-app/gradio"})
```

### **Alternative Research Methods for Specialists (Under Waiver)**

**ACCEPTABLE for specialist agents:**

- Review existing project documentation and patterns
- Analyze current codebase implementation conventions
- Study framework usage examples in existing code
- Research through standard documentation analysis methods
- **ENHANCED**: Focus on enhanced JSON architecture patterns
- **ENHANCED**: Study dual parser architecture and schema validation approaches

  "head": 50,     // Optional: first N lines
  "tail": 50      // Optional: last N lines
}

// Read multiple files efficiently
mcp_filesystem_read_multiple_files

}

// Get file metadata
mcp_filesystem_get_file_info
{
  "path": "/path/to/file.py"
}
```

### **Alternative File Operations for Specialists (Under Waiver)**

**ACCEPTABLE for specialist agents:**

- Use standard Claude Read tool for file operations
- Use standard Claude LS tool for directory listing

## üîÑ Updated Tool Integration Patterns (Enhanced Architecture)

### **Pattern 1: Orchestrator Research ‚Üí Delegate ‚Üí Monitor**

```javascript
// 1. Research latest patterns (ORCHESTRATOR ONLY)
context7_resolve_library_id({"libraryName": "framework"})
context7_get_library_docs({...})

// 2. Plan delegation strategy (ORCHESTRATOR ONLY)
sequential_thinking({
  "thought": "Based on research, I need to delegate enhanced JSON architecture work to backend-developer as primary architect..."
})

// 3. Delegate to specialists (SPECIALISTS USE STANDARD TOOLS)
// Specialists implement using Read, Write, Edit, LS, Grep, Bash
// Focus on enhanced JSON architecture and coordination
```

### **Pattern 2: Orchestrator Analysis ‚Üí Multi-Agent Coordination**

```javascript
// 1. Break down the problem (ORCHESTRATOR ONLY)
sequential_thinking({
  "thought": "Complex enhanced architecture task has components: JSON schema, FSM, UI integration. Need backend-developer as primary architect..."
})

// 2. Research current best practices (ORCHESTRATOR ONLY)
context7_get_library_docs({...})

// 3. Examine current codebase (ORCHESTRATOR ONLY)
filesystem_read_multiple_files({...})

// 4. Delegate coordinated tasks (SPECIALISTS USE STANDARD TOOLS)
// Primary architect (backend-developer) leads with secondary agent support
// Each specialist uses their preferred standard Claude tools
```
