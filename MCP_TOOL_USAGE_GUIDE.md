## üîß Tool 1: Context7 - Latest Documentation Research

### **Current Enforcement Status**

- **SPECIALIST AGENTS**: ~~NOT REQUIRED~~ (Waived under current policy)
- **TECH LEAD ORCHESTRATOR**: **REQUIRED** (Full enforcement continues)

### **Purpose**

Context7 provides access to the most up-to-date documentation, best practices, and code examples for any library or framework. It's your primary tool for researching current development patterns.

### **When to Use (Orchestrator Only)**

- ‚úÖ Researching latest framework versions (React 18+, Vue 3+, Gradio 4+, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Finding current API syntax and best practices
- ‚úÖ Getting code examples for modern patterns
- ‚úÖ Understanding breaking changes between versions
- ‚úÖ Before orchestrating any complex development delegation

### **When NOT to Use**

- ‚ùå For general programming concepts (use standard knowledge)
- ‚ùå For project-specific code (use filesystem tools)
- ‚ùå For debugging existing code (use other analysis tools)
- ‚ùå **SPECIALIST AGENTS: Not required under current waiver policy**

### **Proper Tool Call Syntax (Orchestrator Only)**

#### Step 1: Resolve Library ID

```javascript
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id
Parameters:
{
  "libraryName": "exact-library-name"  // e.g., "gradio", "react", "fastapi"
}
```

#### Step 2: Get Documentation

```javascript
mcp_context7_get-library-docs
Parameters:
{
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/org/project",     // From step 1 result
  "topic": "specific-topic",                          // Optional: focus area
  "tokens": 5000                                      // Optional: response size limit
}
```

### **Best Practices (Orchestrator Only)**

1. **Always resolve library ID first** - Don't guess the Context7 ID format
2. **Be specific with topics** - "async handling in gradio 4.0" vs just "gradio"
3. **Use appropriate token limits** - 5000-10000 for detailed research
4. **Document findings** - Save key patterns found for team reference

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (Orchestrator Only)**

‚ùå **Wrong**: Guessing library IDs

```javascript
// DON'T DO THIS
"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio/gradio"  // Wrong format
```

‚úÖ **Correct**: Always resolve first

```javascript
// Step 1: Resolve
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id({"libraryName": "gradio"})
// Result: "/gradio-app/gradio"

// Step 2: Use resolved ID
mcp_context7_get-library-docs({"context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio-app/gradio"})
```

### **Alternative Research Methods for Specialists (Under Waiver)**

**ACCEPTABLE for specialist agents:**

- Review existing project documentation and patterns
- Analyze current codebase implementation conventions
- Study framework usage examples in existing code
- Research through standard documentation analysis methods

## üö® Updated Enforcement Protocol

### **Tool Usage Violations**

**For @tech-lead-orchestrator (Full MCP Enforcement):**

1. **Not using MCP sequential-thinking** ‚Üí Orchestration lacks systematic analysis
2. **Not using MCP context7 research** ‚Üí Delegation may use outdated patterns
3. **Not using MCP filesystem tools** ‚Üí Orchestration file operations inefficient

**For Specialist Agents (Under Waiver - No MCP Violations):**

1. **Not using systematic analysis** ‚Üí Implementation lacks structure
2. **Not researching project patterns** ‚Üí May use inconsistent approaches
3. **Poor documentation** ‚Üí Implementation decisions not explained
4. **Missing test scripts** ‚Üí Bug fixes not properly validated

### **Quality Standards (All Agents)**

All tool usage must meet these standards:

- **Purposeful**: Clear reason for approach selection
- **Efficient**: Use most appropriate tools available
- **Complete**: All required analysis and documentation provided
- **Integrated**: Tools work together toward the goal

---

**FINAL REMINDER**:

- **SPECIALIST AGENTS**: Currently operate under temporary MCP tool waiver - use standard Claude tools with high quality standards
