This repository contains official examples and demos built by the Polygon.io team. These examples showcase how to use our REST and WebSocket APIs to access market data across stocks, options, crypto, forex, and more.

## What's Included

- Quickstart demos for different asset classes and API endpoints
- Examples using our client libraries
- Integrations with databases, charting tools, and analytics platforms
- Utility scripts and helper functions

## Getting Started

Most examples require a Polygon.io API key. If you need an API key, [sign up here](https://polygon.io) to get started. Set it using an environment variable:

```bash

```

Then follow the README in each example folder for setup instructions.
