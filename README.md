## Quickstart (with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you don't have it:**

   ```sh
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Get your API keys:**
   - [Polygon.io API key](https://polygon.io/)
   - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

3. **Create a `.env` at the project root (recommended):**

   ```env
   POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   # Optional: pricing for cost estimates (USD)
   OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=0.25
   OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=2.00
   ```

4. **Choose your interface:**

   **Enhanced OpenAI GPT-5 CLI (Recommended):**
   ```sh
   uv run gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/src/main.py
   ```

   **Original CLI:**
   ```sh
   uv run market_parser_demo.py
   ```

   **Enhanced React Web Interface:**
   ```sh
   # Terminal 1: Start FastAPI server
   cd gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp
   uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   
   # Terminal 2: Start React frontend
   cd frontend_OpenAI
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

5. **Type your question and press Enter!**

   Type `exit` to quit (CLI) or use the web interface.

## Enhanced Web GUI

You can also use a web-based GUI (Gradio) that provides structured analysis tools with a simplified, chat-focused interface.

- Run the GUI:

  ```sh
  uv run chat_ui.py
  ```
  
  **Features Available in Enhanced Web UI:**
  - 🧠 **State Management** - Simple workflow management (IDLE → PROCESSING → COMPLETE → ERROR)
  - 📊 **Three Analysis Buttons** - Stock Snapshot, Support & Resistance, Technical Analysis
  - 🎯 **Smart Ticker Detection** - Automatic extraction from conversation context
  - 💬 **Single Chat Interface** - All interactions in one consolidated conversation view
  - 💬 **Conversational Responses** - Natural language responses for all interactions
  - ⏳ **Real-time Loading States** - Step-by-step progress feedback during analysis
  - 🛡️ **Error Recovery** - Non-blocking error recovery with immediate button retry
  - 🔍 **Monitoring** - Debug logging and performance tracking
  - 📈 **Usage Tracking** - Token usage monitoring

- The app will print a local URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) to open in your browser.
- Pricing env vars (set in `.env`) will be used for cost estimates just like the CLI.

Environment variables:

- `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional, default `gpt-5-mini`)
- `HOST` and `PORT` to override GUI host/port

## Pricing and Cost Estimates

Set these optional env vars to compute accurate cost estimates (USD per 1M tokens):

```env
# Current OpenAI pricing for gpt-5-mini (as of 2025)
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=0.25
OPENAI_GPT5_MINI_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M=2.00
```

At the end of each request, the CLI prints:

- Per message: input tokens, output tokens, input cost, output cost
- Session cumulative totals across the current run

Example snippet:

```text
Per Message Usage & Cost:
  - Input tokens: 1,234 | Input cost: $0.000309
  - Output tokens: 2,345 | Output cost: $0.004690
  - Message total cost: $0.004999

Session Total (Cumulative):
  - Total input tokens: 8,765 | Total input cost: $0.002191
  - Total output tokens: 9,876 | Total output cost: $0.019752
  - Session total cost: $0.021943
```

## Example Usage

### Enhanced OpenAI GPT-5 CLI

```text
> Tesla stock analysis
✔ Query processed successfully!
Agent Response:

🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS
📈 TSLA showing bullish momentum with 15% gain this week
💰 Strong quarterly earnings beat expectations
🏢 Tesla's expansion into energy storage markets
📊 Technical indicators suggest continued upward trend

📊 DETAILED ANALYSIS
Tesla (TSLA) is currently trading at $245.67, representing a significant 
bullish rally from last week's lows. The stock has demonstrated strong 
bullish signals with increased volume and positive momentum indicators...

⚠️ DISCLAIMER
This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be 
considered financial advice.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

> exit
Goodbye!
```

### Original CLI

```text
> Tesla price now
✔ Query processed successfully!
Agent Response:
$TSLA is currently trading at $XXX.XX (as of 2024-06-07 15:30:00 UTC).
---------------------

> exit
Goodbye!
```

For reference, this is the system prompt used with every query:

```text
system_prompt=(
    "You are an expert financial analyst. Note that when using Polygon tools, prices are already stock split adjusted. "
    "Use the latest data available. Always double check your math. "
    "For any questions about the current date, use the 'get_today_date' tool. "
    "For long or complex queries, break the query into logical subtasks and process each subtask in order."
)
```

Be specific in your prompt. The better the prompt - the better the response.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing API Key:**

  If you see an error about `POLYGON_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, make sure your `.env` file is in the project root.

- **Dependencies:**

  If you get `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure your `pyproject.toml` lists:
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `rich`
  - `pydantic-ai-slim[openai]`
  - `gradio`

  If you prefer, you can use pip instead:

  ```sh
  pip install python-dotenv rich "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]" gradio
  python market_parser_demo.py
  ```

- **Import Errors with Enhanced Structure:**

  With the enhanced structure, update imports to use the new patterns:
  ```python
  # Enhanced import patterns:
  from src.response_parser import ResponseParser
  from src.response_manager import ResponseManager, ProcessingMode
  from src.prompt_templates import PromptTemplateManager
  from stock_data_fsm.states import AppState, StateContext
  ```

- **Test Execution:**

  Run tests from the project root using the enhanced structure:
  ```sh
  # All tests (comprehensive coverage)
  uv run pytest tests/
  
  # Specific test files
  uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py
  
  # Simplified architecture tests
  uv run pytest tests/test_simplified_*.py
  
  # Performance validation
  uv run python tests/validate_performance_optimization.py
  ```

- **Chat Interface Issues:**

  The simplified system uses a single chat interface:
  - Button clicks display full prompts and conversational responses in chat
  - User messages return conversational text responses
  - All interactions are visible in one conversation flow
  - Export functionality available for external analysis

- **UI Stuck in Loading State:**

  With the simple state management:
  - Click any analysis button to trigger immediate recovery
  - System automatically returns to IDLE state after errors
  - No system restart required for error recovery
  - Check debug logs for error analysis

- **Performance Issues:**

  Architecture includes monitoring:
  - Monitor usage metrics and cost tracking
  - Review processing efficiency
  - Check resource usage
  - Analyze debug logs for bottlenecks

- **Incorrect Responses**

  AI Data can be incorrect. Like all LLM generated responses, please double check.

- **Other errors:**

  All errors are printed in red in the terminal for easy debugging.
