# Market Parser with Polygon MCP Server

A Python CLI and React web application for natural language financial
queries using the [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) MCP server and OpenAI
GPT-5 models via the OpenAI Agents SDK. Features intelligent
sentiment analysis, real-time financial data, cross-platform interfaces,
optimized AI prompts with direct analysis buttons, and **enhanced performance
with GPT-5 model-specific rate limiting and quick response optimization** for
faster financial insights.

## STANDARDIZED TEST PROMPTS

**CRITICAL:** All testing MUST use these standardized prompts to ensure
consistent, quick responses (30-60 seconds) and avoid false failures from
complex prompts.

### Quick Response Test Prompts (Use These Only)

1. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: What is the current
   Market Status?"**
2. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"**
3. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Full Market Snapshot: SPY, QQQ, IWM"**
4. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, what was the closing price of GME today?"**
5. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, how is SOUN performance doing this week?"**
6. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Top Market Movers Today for Gainers"**
7. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Top Market Movers Today for Losers"**
8. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Support & Resistance Levels NVDA"**
9. **"Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: Based on Market Status
   Date, Technical Analysis SPY"**

**MANDATORY RULES:**

- ‚úÖ Use ONLY these prompts for testing
- ‚úÖ Copy prompts EXACTLY as written
- ‚úÖ Expected response time: 30-60 seconds
- ‚ùå DO NOT create custom prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT modify these prompts
- ‚ùå DO NOT use complex, open-ended queries

**üìã COMPLETE PROMPT REFERENCE:** For the full standardized test prompts
documentation, see `tests/playwright/test_prompts.md`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Python package manager
- **[Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)** - For React frontend
- **API Keys**: [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd market-parser-polygon-mcp
   ```

2. **Install uv if needed:**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys:
   # POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key_here
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```

   **Note:** All non-sensitive configuration is now centralized in
   `config/app.config.json`. Only API keys are stored in `.env`.

**One-Click Application Startup (Recommended):**

The startup scripts automatically manage all development servers and
**open the application in your browser**.

```bash
# Option 1: Main startup script (recommended)
./start-app.sh

# Option 2: XTerm version for better terminal compatibility
./start-app-xterm.sh

# Option 3: Use npm scripts
npm run start:app          # Main script
npm run start:app:xterm    # XTerm version
```

**Prerequisites:** uv, Node.js 18+, API keys in .env

## Script Variants

### start-app.sh (Main Script)

- **Terminal Support**: Tries `gnome-terminal` first, falls back to `xterm`
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on most Linux distributions and macOS
- **Automatic Fallback**: Gracefully handles missing terminal emulators

### start-app-xterm.sh (XTerm Version)

- **XTerm Focused**: Specifically designed for xterm users
- **Window Positioning**: Places backend and frontend terminals side-by-side
- **Font Configuration**: Uses readable DejaVu Sans Mono font
- **Enhanced Display**: Better window titles and layout

## What the Scripts Do

### üîÑ Server Cleanup

- Kills existing development servers (uvicorn, vite)
- **Preserves MCP servers** - does not interfere with MCP processes
- Waits for processes to terminate gracefully

### üöÄ Server Startup

- **Backend**: Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend**: Starts Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Opens each server in a separate terminal window for easy monitoring
- Uses consistent ports from centralized configuration (no dynamic allocation)

### ‚úÖ Health Verification

- Performs health checks on both servers
- Retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals
- Verifies backend `/health` endpoint responds
- Verifies frontend serves content properly

### üåê Browser Launch

- **NOTIFIES USER TO LAUNCH BROWSER TO START THE APP WHEN SERVERS ARE READY**

**Access:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (React app) or <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (API docs)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**

```bash
# Check .env file has API keys
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify dependencies
uv install
```

**Frontend connection errors:**

```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Check ports are available
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

**API key issues:**

- Ensure both `POLYGON_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
