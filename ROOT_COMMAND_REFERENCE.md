```

### Test Locations
- **Playwright Tests**: `/tests/playwright/` - Contains B001-B016 test suite
- **Test Results**: Stored in `test-results/` directory
- **Test Reports**: Generated in HTML format for detailed analysis

## ‚ö° Performance & Lighthouse

### Performance Analysis
```bash
npm run lighthouse                    # Full Lighthouse audit
npm run lighthouse:collect           # Collect performance metrics only
npm run lighthouse:assert            # Assert performance thresholds
npm run lighthouse:upload            # Upload results to LHCI server
npm run lighthouse:live-server       # Production build + Lighthouse instructions
npm run lighthouse:live-server:staging # Staging build + Lighthouse instructions
```

### Lighthouse Workflow
1. Run `npm run lighthouse:live-server` to build and get setup instructions
2. Start Live Server from VS Code (as instructed)
3. Lighthouse will test performance, PWA features, and accessibility

## üåê Serving & Deployment

### Local Serving
```bash
npm run serve            # Build development + serve instructions
npm run serve:staging    # Build staging + serve instructions
npm run serve:production # Build production + serve instructions
```

### Cross-Device Testing
```bash
npm run cross-device:setup    # Production build + network access instructions
npm run cross-device:staging  # Staging build + network access instructions
npm run live-server:help      # Detailed Live Server configuration help
```

### Serving Workflow
1. Commands build the appropriate version and provide instructions
2. Use VS Code Live Server extension to serve built files
3. Different configurations available for development (5500), staging (5501), production (5502)
4. Network access configured for mobile device testing

## üîß Installation & Maintenance

### Installation
```bash
npm run install:all      # Install root + frontend dependencies
npm run install:backend  # Install Python dependencies only
npm run install:frontend # Install Node.js dependencies only
```

### Cleaning
```bash
npm run clean            # Remove node_modules, frontend/node_modules, dist, test-results
npm run clean:cache      # Remove various cache directories
npm run clean:install    # Clean + install all dependencies
npm run clean:full       # Clean + clean cache + install all dependencies
```

### Maintenance Workflow
- `npm run clean:full` for complete reset when having issues
- `npm run reset` for quick clean + install + start development
- Dependencies are automatically managed through `postinstall` hook

## üõ†Ô∏è Utility Commands

### Status & Health Monitoring
```bash
npm run status  # Check backend (8000) and frontend (3000) health
npm run health  # Alias for npm run status
npm run reset   # Clean + install + start development (full reset)
```

### Status Output Example
```
=== Backend Status ===
{"status":"healthy","message":"Financial Analysis API is running","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0"}
=== Frontend Status ===
Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
```

## üö® Command Proxy Strategy

All commands use the `cd directory && command` strategy to maintain:

- **Root-Level Access**: All commands work from project root
- **No Directory Navigation**: Developers never need to `cd` into subdirectories
- **Consistent Interface**: Same command patterns across all tools
- **Environment Isolation**: Each command runs in appropriate directory context

## üîç Troubleshooting Commands

### Common Issues & Solutions
```bash
# Dependency issues
npm run clean:full

# Port conflicts
npm run status  # Check what's running
npm run reset   # Clean restart

# Build issues
npm run clean && npm run build

# Test failures
npm run test:playwright:debug  # Debug specific test issues
```

### Environment Verification
```bash
# Check all systems
npm run status && npm run check:all

# Verify installations
npm run install:all
```

This command reference provides complete documentation for the root-level command proxy system, enabling efficient development workflows without directory navigation requirements.
