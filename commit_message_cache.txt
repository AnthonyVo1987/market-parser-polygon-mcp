feat: Add comprehensive Shared Persistent Agent Implementation Plan

- Add new implementation plan document with 6-phase approach for session persistence and agent caching
- Include detailed technical specifications, code examples, and monitoring implementation
- Add comprehensive testing strategy, rollback procedures, and success metrics
- Update task planning document with implementation plan generation and review tasks
- Fix markdown formatting in test prompts documentation
- Update Serena cache with latest document symbols

The implementation plan addresses performance bottlenecks in agent creation while maintaining conversation memory and improving response times by 0.4-2.0 seconds per session through session persistence and agent caching architecture.
