fix: Align direct_prompts.py system prompts with core messaging elements

## Prompt Consistency Enhancement
- Added core messaging elements to all system prompts in direct_prompts.py
- Ensured consistency with main.py and optimized_agent_instructions.py
- Aligned all prompt files with GPT-5 optimization standards

## Core Messaging Elements Added
- Real-time tools access: "TOOLS: Polygon.io MCP server for live market data"
- Quick responses: "RESPOND: Quickly with minimal tool calls for faster analysis"
- Consistent structure across all analysis types (SNAPSHOT, SUPPORT_RESISTANCE, TECHNICAL, GENERAL)
- Maintained existing low verbosity and structured output format

## Analysis Types Updated
- SNAPSHOT: Market snapshots with real-time data access
- SUPPORT_RESISTANCE: Technical analysis with real-time tools
- TECHNICAL: Comprehensive analysis with minimal tool calls
- GENERAL: Financial analysis with optimized response speed

## Integration Verification
- All three prompt files now consistently include core messaging elements
- Maintains GPT-5 optimization with 60% verbosity reduction
- Preserves structured output format (KEY TAKEAWAYS â†’ DETAILED ANALYSIS)
- Ensures quick responses with minimal tool calls across all analysis types

## Files Modified
- src/backend/direct_prompts.py: Enhanced system prompts with core messaging elements

## Impact
- Consistent AI behavior across all prompt systems
- Improved response speed with minimal tool calls
- Enhanced real-time data access awareness
- Maintained GPT-5 optimization standards
