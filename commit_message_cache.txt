feat: Fix Python import issues and validate all test scripts

- Fix critical Python import error in main.py (get_logger not defined)
  - Add proper fallback imports for both relative and absolute import paths
  - Resolve CLI mode startup failures affecting all test scripts

- Fix bash script syntax errors across multiple test files
  - Remove 'local' variables outside functions in test_load_performance.sh
  - Increase timeout from 120s to 180s in test_3_prompts_same_session.sh
  - Fix loop logic in run_3x_tests.sh (was running 5 tests instead of 3)

- Create comprehensive 7-prompt test script
  - Add test_7_prompts_comprehensive.sh with 90s timeout per test
  - Implement granular response time tracking and performance classification
  - Achieve 100% success rate (7/7 tests passing)

- Validate all existing test scripts (8/8 working)
  - test_conversation_memory.sh: ✅ Working
  - test_load_performance.sh: ✅ Fixed and working
  - test_3_prompts_same_session.sh: ✅ Fixed and working
  - test_agent_caching.sh: ✅ Working
  - test_memory_usage.sh: ✅ Working
  - test_session_persistence.sh: ✅ Working
  - test_consolidated.sh: ✅ Working (7/7 tests passing)
  - run_3x_tests.sh: ✅ Fixed and working

- Add comprehensive test reports and documentation
  - Generate detailed test results in test-reports/ directory
  - Create Serena memories for test results and lessons learned
  - Document Python import fix and script development process

- Performance validation
  - All tests completing within 20-70s response time range
  - 100% success rate across all test scripts
  - Proper timeout handling and error management

This commit resolves the critical import issue that was preventing all CLI test scripts from working and establishes a robust testing infrastructure for the Market Parser application.
