feat: Regenerate comprehensive Shared Persistent Agent Implementation Plan

- Regenerate shared_persistent_agent_implementation_plan.md with corrected ROI analysis
- Include real-world usage patterns (multi-message sessions) showing 4-20s improvement per session
- Add comprehensive 6-phase implementation plan with detailed technical specifications
- Include specific dead code removal details with line numbers from main.py
- Add code examples, testing strategies, and validation procedures
- Update Serena memory with corrected analysis and key insights
- Fix markdown formatting issues (trailing newline)
- Update task planning document with implementation plan generation tasks

The regenerated plan addresses performance bottlenecks in agent creation while maintaining conversation memory and improving response times by 4-20 seconds per session through session persistence and agent caching architecture.
