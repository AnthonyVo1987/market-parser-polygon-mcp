fix: implement 30-second timeout mechanism and fix startup scripts

- **Script Fixes**: Fixed both start-app.sh and start-app-xterm.sh to exit cleanly
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Added 30-second timeout fallback to prevent hanging
- **WSL2 Compatibility**: Enhanced start-app-xterm.sh with tmux session support
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic detection of X11 vs WSL2/headless environments
- **AI Agent Friendly**: Scripts now exit within 10-15 seconds, preventing agent blocking
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated CLAUDE.md and START_SCRIPT_README.md to reflect working status
- **Background Process Support**: start-app.sh uses background processes in WSL2 mode
- **Session Management**: start-app-xterm.sh uses tmux sessions for better WSL2 experience
- **Logging**: Added proper log file management for background processes
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and troubleshooting guidance

Both startup scripts now work reliably in all environments with proper exit mechanisms.
