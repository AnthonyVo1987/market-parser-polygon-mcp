feat: Complete legacy logging removal for performance optimization

- Remove all custom logging infrastructure (1000+ lines of code)
- Delete logging files: src/backend/utils/logger.py, src/frontend/utils/logger.ts, src/frontend/hooks/useDebugLog.ts
- Remove logging calls from: src/backend/main.py, src/frontend/components/ChatInterface_OpenAI.tsx, src/frontend/services/api_OpenAI.ts, src/frontend/main.tsx, src/frontend/wdyr.ts
- Clean up performance monitoring logging functions and unused variables
- Fix linting issues and unused exception variables
- Add comprehensive implementation plan (TODO_task_plan.md)
- Update Serena memories with completion documentation
- Maintain full functionality while eliminating logging overhead
- Rely solely on default browser console and dev server logs

Performance benefits:
- Reduced codebase complexity by 1000+ lines
- Eliminated logging overhead in production
- Simplified debugging workflow
- Improved application performance

All core functionality preserved and tested (CLI + GUI).
