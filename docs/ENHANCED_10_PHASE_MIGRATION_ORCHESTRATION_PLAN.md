# 10-Phase Migration Plan

## Overview

Migration from legacy CLI/Gradio to OpenAI GPT-5 React system with basic specialist coordination for rapid prototyping.

## Specialist Assignments

### Phase Responsibilities

| Specialist | Primary Phases | Notes |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| @code-archaeologist | 1 | Initial setup and analysis |
| @documentation-specialist | 2, 8 | Documentation tasks |
| @backend-developer | 3, 5 | Python/FastAPI work |
| @code-reviewer | 4, 9, 10 | Review and validation |
| @api-architect | 7 | Configuration management |
| @react-component-architect | 6 | Frontend migration |

## Simple Coordination

### Basic Handoff Process

1. Complete assigned phase tasks
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Commit changes with clear message
4. Notify next specialist in conversation

**Note:** Focus on getting functionality working - no complex protocols needed for prototyping stage.

## Basic Validation

### Phase Completion Checks

| Phase | Validator | Simple Check |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | @documentation-specialist | Branch created successfully |
| 2 | @code-reviewer | Documentation updated |
| 3 | @code-reviewer | Files removed, no errors |
| 4 | @backend-developer | Clean removal |
| 5 | @api-architect | System works at root level |
| 6 | @backend-developer | Frontend builds |
| 7 | @backend-developer | Configuration works |
| 8 | @code-reviewer | Documentation complete |
| 9 | @documentation-specialist | Tests work |
| 10 | @api-architect | Everything functional |

## Execution Order

### Simple Sequence

**Sequential Phases (one at a time):**
1. Phase 1: Setup
2. Phase 2: Documentation prep
3. Phase 3: Remove legacy Python
4. Phase 4: Remove legacy tests
5. Phase 5: Move to root
6. Phase 6: Move frontend
7. Phase 7: Update config
8. Phase 8: Update docs
9. Phase 9: Update tests
10. Phase 10: Final check

**Simple Rule:** Complete each phase before starting the next. Focus on making it work, not optimizing execution time.

## Safety Plan

### Basic Safety

**Backup Strategy:**
- Work on experimental branch: `migration-experimental`
- Keep main branch untouched
- If anything breaks: `git checkout main`

**Recovery:**
- Any phase fails: Switch back to main branch
- Start over if needed
- Main branch always has working system

---

## 📋 PHASE 1: Pre-Migration Validation & Branch Setup

### Task Assignment

**Specialist:** @code-archaeologist

### Simple Tasks

1. Create experimental branch
2. Document what we're starting with

### Completion Check
- [ ] Branch created and working
- [ ] Can switch back to main if needed

### Detailed Tasks with MCP Tools

1. **Experimental Branch Setup (code-archaeologist)**
   ```bash
   # Using Bash tool
   git status --porcelain  # Ensure clean working directory
   git branch migration-experimental
   git checkout migration-experimental
   echo "Migration work branch created from main branch state"
   ```

2. **System State Validation (documentation-specialist)**
   ```python
   # Using mcp__filesystem tools
   validation_checklist = {
       "main_branch_clean": check_git_status(),
       "cli_operational": test_cli(),
       "react_ui_builds": test_frontend_build(),
       "api_responsive": test_api_health(),
       "tests_passing": run_test_suite()
   }
   ```

3. **Branch Strategy Documentation (both specialists)**
   - Document main branch as safety fallback
   - Create experimental branch workflow guide
   - Define emergency branch switching procedures

## 📋 PHASE 2: Documentation Migration Preparation

### Task Assignment

**Specialist:** @documentation-specialist

### Simple Tasks

1. Look at what docs we have

   | CLAUDE.md | ✓ | ✓ | | /CLAUDE.md |
   | old_gradio_docs.md | | | ✓ | - |
   ```

2. **Critical Documentation State Recording**
   ```bash
   # Record current documentation state on main branch
   git checkout main
   find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec ls -la {} \; > /tmp/docs_state_main.log
   find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -exec ls -la {} \; >> /tmp/docs_state_main.log

## Success Criteria

### What Success Looks Like

**Basic functionality works:**
- CLI runs: `uv run src/main.py`
- API responds: Backend starts and responds to requests
- Frontend works: React app builds and connects to API
- Documentation updated: Installation steps work

**That's it for prototyping stage.** No need for complex metrics or optimization.

---

## Key Points

1. **Keep it simple**: Focus on getting it working, not perfect
2. **One thing at a time**: Complete each phase before starting next
3. **Safety first**: Always be able to go back to working main branch
4. **Document as needed**: Update docs so others can use the system
5. **Test basic functionality**: Make sure key features work

---

## Communication

### Simple Updates

When completing a phase:
1. Say what you did
2. Note any issues
3. Confirm next specialist can start

### Emergency Recovery

If anything breaks:
```bash
git checkout main
# You're back to working system
```

---

## Tools Needed

**All specialists should use MCP tools as specified in CLAUDE.md:**
- `mcp__filesystem__*` for file operations
- `Bash` for commands
- Standard development tools
