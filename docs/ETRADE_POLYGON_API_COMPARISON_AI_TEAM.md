### 18.3 Cost Optimization Implementation

**gpt-5-mini Token Efficiency**:
```python
class CostOptimizedRequestHandler:
    """Optimize API calls to reduce gpt-5-mini token usage"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.cache_ttl = 300  # 5 minutes
        
    async def get_market_data(self, symbol: str):
        """Cached data retrieval to reduce token costs"""
        cache_key = f"{symbol}_{int(time.time() / self.cache_ttl)}"
        
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            # Cache hit reduces API calls and gpt-5-mini context
            return self.cache[cache_key]
            
        # Batch multiple requests when possible
        data = await self.batch_api_request([symbol])
        self.cache[cache_key] = data
        return data
        
    async def batch_api_request(self, symbols: List[str]):
        """Batch requests to maximize rate limit efficiency"""
        # Polygon.io supports multiple symbols in single request
        # Reduces overall API calls and gpt-5-mini processing time
        pass
```

- API response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- End-to-end analysis completion time
- FSM state transition latency

### 19.2 Monitoring Implementation

```python
class PerformanceMetrics:
    """Comprehensive performance monitoring for rate limit impact"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'api_response_times': [],
            'token_usage_per_request': [],
            'rate_limit_hits': 0,
            'cache_hit_ratio': 0.0,
            'cost_per_analysis': []
        }
    
    def record_api_call(self, response_time: float, tokens_used: int):
        """Record metrics for cost and speed analysis"""
        self.metrics['api_response_times'].append(response_time)
        self.metrics['token_usage_per_request'].append(tokens_used)
        
        # Calculate running averages for performance targets
        avg_response_time = sum(self.metrics['api_response_times']) / len(self.metrics['api_response_times'])
        avg_tokens = sum(self.metrics['token_usage_per_request']) / len(self.metrics['token_usage_per_request'])
        
        return {
            'avg_response_time': avg_response_time,
            'avg_token_usage': avg_tokens,
            'cost_reduction_achieved': self.calculate_cost_reduction(),
            'speed_improvement_achieved': self.calculate_speed_improvement()
        }
```
