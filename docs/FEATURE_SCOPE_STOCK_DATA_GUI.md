# Feature Scope: Simplified Stock Data GUI - JSON-Only Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the simplified feature scope for the Market Parser application following the comprehensive system simplification completed in 2025. The application now uses a streamlined JSON-only architecture with a 5-state FSM for maximum reliability and transparency.

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Simplified architecture implemented and tested  
**Complexity:** 🟢 LOW - Simplified 5-state FSM with JSON-only outputs  
**Test Success Rate:** 80/80 tests passing (100% success rate)  

## Simplified Feature Overview

### Current Implementation (Post-Simplification)

1. **JSON Output System** for displaying:
   - Stock Snapshot (current price, volume, basic metrics in JSON format)
   - Support & Resistance Levels (key levels and trend data in JSON format)
   - Technical Analysis (indicators and signals in JSON format)

2. **Three Analysis Buttons** that trigger specific AI prompts:
   - "📈 Stock Snapshot" button
   - "🎯 Support & Resistance" button  
   - "🔧 Technical Analysis" button

3. **Simplified Operation**:
   - Button clicks trigger AI analysis with JSON output
   - Raw JSON responses displayed in dedicated textboxes
   - Non-blocking error recovery with immediate button retry
   - Complete data transparency with copy/paste functionality

## Simplified Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

```python
gr.Blocks() layout:
├── Header Section
├── Main Content (gr.Row)
│   ├── Chat Section (gr.Column, scale=2)
│   │   ├── Chatbot
│   │   ├── Message Input
│   │   └── Send Button
│   └── JSON Display Section (gr.Column, scale=1)
│       ├── Status Display
│       └── JSON Output Row
│           ├── Stock Snapshot JSON (gr.Code)
│           ├── Support/Resistance JSON (gr.Code)
│           └── Technical Analysis JSON (gr.Code)
└── Analysis Actions Section
    └── Button Row (📈 Stock Snapshot | 🎯 S&R | 🔧 Technical)
```

### Simplified 5-State FSM Architecture

**States Implemented:**
```python
class AppState(Enum):
    IDLE = auto()                 # Ready for user interaction
    BUTTON_TRIGGERED = auto()     # User clicked analysis button
    AI_PROCESSING = auto()        # Waiting for AI response
    RESPONSE_RECEIVED = auto()    # AI response ready for display
    ERROR = auto()                # Error state with immediate recovery
```

**State Flow:**
```
IDLE → BUTTON_TRIGGERED → AI_PROCESSING → RESPONSE_RECEIVED → IDLE
  ↑                                                              │
  └─────────────────── ERROR ←──────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ↓
                   (button_retry)
                         │
                         ↓
                       IDLE
```

## Performance Improvements

### Response Time Metrics

**Before (Complex System):**
- Response display: 2-5 seconds
- Error recovery: 10-30 seconds (system restart)
- UI responsiveness: Often frozen during processing

**After (Simplified System):**
- Response display: 0.1-0.3 seconds (90% improvement)
- Error recovery: <1 second (button retry)
- UI responsiveness: Always responsive (non-blocking)

### Reliability Metrics

**Test Success Rate:**
