## Comprehensive JSON System

### Schema Management

**JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 Compliance:**
- Version-controlled schema definitions in `src/json_schemas.py`
- Backward compatibility considerations with migration strategies
- Business rules integrated into schema validation

**Schema Evolution Process:**
1. Backend-developer designs new schemas as primary architect
2. API-architect reviews external contract implications
3. Code-reviewer validates security and integrity
4. Performance-optimizer assesses performance impact

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
AI Response → Primary JSON Parser → Schema Validation → Business Rules → Confidence Scoring → UI Display
                      ↓ (fallback)
                 Regex Parser → Data Extraction → Validation Attempt → Confidence Scoring → UI Display
```

### Key Components

**Primary JSON Parser (`src/json_parser.py`):**
- High-performance JSON extraction from AI responses
- Handles structured JSON with optimal parsing speed
- Integrated with schema validation pipeline

**Regex Fallback Parser:**
- Maximum compatibility for malformed or partial responses
- Pattern-based data extraction as safety net
- Confidence scoring to indicate data quality

**Schema Validator (`src/schema_validator.py`):**
- Multi-layer validation with business rules
- Auto-correction capabilities where possible
- Detailed error reporting with context preservation

### Confidence Scoring System

**Scoring Criteria:**
- JSON structure completeness (0-40 points)
- Schema validation success (0-30 points)
- Business rule compliance (0-20 points)
- Data consistency checks (0-10 points)

**Scoring Ranges:**
- 90-100: High confidence, full validation passed
- 70-89: Good confidence, minor validation issues
- 50-69: Medium confidence, some data extraction concerns
- <50: Low confidence, manual review recommended

### Validation Configuration

**Schema Definitions (`src/json_schemas.py`):**
```python
STOCK_SNAPSHOT_SCHEMA = {
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "symbol": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[A-Z]{1,5}$"},
        "price": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0},
        "change": {"type": "number"},
        "timestamp": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"}
    },
    "required": ["symbol", "price", "timestamp"]
}
```
