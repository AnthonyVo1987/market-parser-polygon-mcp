---

## Dual Response Modes

The system intelligently handles two types of interactions:

### Mode 1: User Messages (Conversational)

**When you type a message and send:**
- AI responds with natural, conversational language
- Optimized for human readability and understanding
- Includes explanations and context
- Easy to read and interpret

**Example:**
```
You: What is Tesla's current stock price?

AI: Tesla (TSLA) is currently trading at $248.50 as of the latest market data. 
The stock has shown resilience today, maintaining relatively stable pricing 
compared to recent volatility. This represents the most current available 
price from Polygon.io's real-time feed.
```

### Mode 2: Button Clicks (Structured JSON)

**When you click an analysis button:**
- System shows the full prompt being sent to AI
- AI responds with structured JSON data
- All data fields clearly organized
- Ideal for technical analysis and data export

**Example:**
```
System Prompt: "Please provide a comprehensive stock snapshot analysis for the ticker symbol mentioned in our conversation. Use current market data and provide detailed fundamental and technical metrics in structured JSON format..."

AI Response:
{
  "ticker": "TSLA",
  "company_name": "Tesla Inc",
  "current_price": 248.50,
  "price_change": "+2.34",
  "percent_change": "+0.95%",
  "volume": 45234567,
  "market_cap": 792000000000,
  "analysis": {
    "trend": "bullish",
    "support_level": 245.00,
    "resistance_level": 255.00
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Dual Modes

- **Flexibility**: Choose the right response type for your needs
- **Efficiency**: JSON for data analysis, conversational for understanding
- **Transparency**: See exactly what prompts are being used
- **Data Access**: Easy export of structured data from JSON responses
- **User Experience**: Natural conversation flow with technical precision when needed

## Understanding JSON Responses in Chat

### JSON Structure in Chat

When you click an analysis button, the JSON response appears directly in the chat conversation:

1. **System Prompt Display**: See exactly what prompt was sent
2. **Formatted JSON**: Structured data with proper indentation
3. **Field Explanations**: Understand what each data point means
4. **Context Preservation**: JSON remains in conversation history

### Reading JSON Data

**Key Principles:**
- **Objects**: Grouped data in `{}`
- **Arrays**: Lists of values in `[]`
- **Strings**: Text values in quotes
- **Numbers**: Numeric values without quotes
- **Booleans**: true/false values

**Example Interpretation:**
```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",          // Stock symbol
  "current_price": 185.25,   // Price in USD
  "trend": "bullish",        // Market direction
  "confidence": 0.85,        // Confidence score (0-1)
  "active": true             // Boolean indicator
}
```

### Data Validation

The system provides:
- **Schema Validation**: All JSON follows predefined structures
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-validation of related fields
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for invalid data
- **Fallback Processing**: Backup parsing for edge cases

### Export and Analysis

JSON responses can be:
- **Copied directly** from chat for external analysis
- **Exported** as part of conversation history
- **Processed** by external tools and spreadsheets
- **Validated** against schemas for accuracy
