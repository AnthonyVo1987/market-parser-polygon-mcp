## Executive Summary

This consolidated analysis merges two independent comprehensive evaluations of 6 major financial data API providers as alternatives to Polygon.io for the Market Parser application. By combining Context7 research methodology with AI Team systematic analysis, this final assessment provides both technical implementation details and comprehensive cost analysis to support strategic decision-making.

### Unified Key Findings

**Current Baseline**: Polygon.io at $58/month ($29 Stocks + $29 Options) with 10/10 authentication simplicity rating

**Cost Range Analysis**: 
- **Verified Lower Cost**: Tradier ($10-35/month confirmed)
- **Estimated Lower Cost**: Alpha Vantage (~$50/month), Finnhub (~$50+/month) 
- **Estimated Higher Cost**: Twelve Data (~$66/month), Alpaca (~$99/month)
- **Unknown Cost**: TD Ameritrade/Schwab (likely included with brokerage account)

**Authentication Complexity Range**: 2/10 (simple API key) to 8/10 (OAuth + brokerage account requirement)

**Options Data Capabilities**: Excellent support confirmed for Alpaca, Tradier, TD Ameritrade/Schwab; Limited/unknown for others

### Strategic Decision Framework

**Decision Tree for Broker Selection:**

**IF** your organization prioritizes stability and proven performance:  
‚Üí **THEN** maintain Polygon.io (Conservative Approach - AI Team Recommendation)  
‚Üí **RESULT**: $58/month, 10/10 authentication simplicity, proven options support  

**IF** your organization requires cost reduction above all else:  
‚Üí **THEN** evaluate Tradier carefully ($10-35/month verified pricing)  
‚Üí **RESULT**: 40-60% cost savings, 8/10 authentication complexity, requires OAuth setup  

**IF** your organization has no options trading requirements:  
‚Üí **THEN** consider Alpha Vantage or Twelve Data (both ~$50-66/month estimated)  
‚Üí **RESULT**: Modest savings, simple authentication, but loss of options capabilities  

**IF** your organization needs enhanced options trading capabilities:  
‚Üí **THEN** evaluate Alpaca (~$99/month estimated, excellent options support)  
‚Üí **RESULT**: Superior options features, 70% cost increase, complex authentication  

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: All pricing estimates require vendor verification before decision-making.

### Strategic Consensus

**Conservative Approach (AI Team Recommendation)**: Maintain Polygon.io for production stability, proven performance, and comprehensive capabilities while monitoring alternatives for future evaluation.

**Progressive Approach (Updated Analysis)**: Due to options data requirements, Twelve Data is NOT suitable for current Market Parser. Consider Alpaca for enhanced options capabilities or Tradier for cost reduction only if authentication complexity is acceptable.

**Unified Risk Assessment**: Migration introduces development complexity (1-6 weeks), authentication changes, and potential capability gaps that may not justify modest cost savings in most scenarios.
