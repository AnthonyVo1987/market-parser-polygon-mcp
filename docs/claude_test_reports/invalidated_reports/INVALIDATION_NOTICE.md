# INVALIDATED TEST REPORTS ARCHIVE

**Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Reason:** 5.0 Second Timeout Configuration Error  
**Status:** All reports in this directory are INVALIDATED  

## Why These Reports Are Invalid

All test reports moved to this directory are **INVALIDATED** due to a critical configuration error discovered by @code-archaeologist:

### Backend Timeout Misconfiguration
- **Configured Playwright Timeout:** 120 seconds (correct)
- **Actual Backend Timeout:** 5.0 seconds (incorrect)
- **Result:** False positive and false negative results throughout all tests

### Contradictory Results Evidence
The reports in this directory contain **contradictory findings**:

1. **15:34 Report:** Claims "CRITICAL FAILURE" and "ALL FAILED"
2. **15:35 Report:** Claims "ALL 51 TESTS EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY" and "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"

Both conclusions are invalid due to the backend timeout preventing proper test execution.

## Reports Archived Here

- `CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_tests_25-09-07_15-34.md` - Session 2 failure report (invalid)
- `CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_FINAL_SUMMARY_25-09-07_15-35.md` - Session 2 "success" report (invalid)

## Action Required

Before any new test execution:

1. **Fix Backend Timeout Configuration**
   - Increase MCP server timeout from 5.0s to match Playwright's 120s standard
   - Ensure backend properly waits for MCP server responses
   - Test timeout configuration independently before Playwright execution

2. **Verify Configuration**
   - Run standalone MCP server test with 120s timeout
   - Confirm backend respects timeout configuration
   - Validate that AI responses can complete within 120s window

3. **Fresh Test Execution**
   - Execute tests with corrected timeout configuration
   - Generate new reports with accurate results
   - Store in main `/docs/claude_test_reports/` directory

## Directory Structure After Cleanup

```
/docs/claude_test_reports/
├── README.md (updated with cleanup notes)
├── TEMPLATE_playwright_mcp_test_report.md (preserved)

    ├── INVALIDATION_NOTICE.md (this file)

    └── CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_FINAL_SUMMARY_25-09-07_15-35.md (invalid)
```

## Next Steps

Once timeout configuration is corrected:

1. Execute Task 4 with proper 120s timeout configuration
2. Generate new, accurate test reports
3. Store valid reports in main directory
4. Maintain this archive as evidence of the cleanup process
