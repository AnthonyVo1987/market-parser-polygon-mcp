# Migration Branch Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the branch strategy for the 10-Phase Migration from legacy CLI/Gradio to OpenAI GPT-5 React system.

## Branch Structure

### Main Branch (master)
- **Purpose**: Safety fallback and working system
- **Status**: Contains functional legacy system
- **Protection**: Never modified during migration
- **Usage**: Emergency recovery point

### Migration Branch (migration-experimental)
- **Purpose**: Active migration work
- **Status**: Created from master branch
- **Usage**: All migration phases executed here
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 completed

## Safety Procedures

### Emergency Recovery
If migration fails at any point:

```bash
# Switch back to working system
git checkout master

# Verify you're on the safe branch
git branch --show-current

# System should be fully operational
```

### Branch Switching Protocol
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Switch to master (safety)
git checkout master

# Switch to migration work
git checkout migration-experimental

# Always verify current branch after switching
git branch --show-current
```

## System State Validation Results (Phase 1)

### CLI Functionality Test
- **Legacy CLI** (`market_parser_demo.py`): FAILED - Permission issues with virtual environment
- **New CLI** (`gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/src/main.py`): WORKING - Starts correctly, waits for input

### API Health Test
- **FastAPI Backend**: WORKING - Server starts successfully on port 8001
- **Startup Process**: Complete with MCP server initialization
- **Status**: Fully operational with proper shutdown

### Frontend Build Test
- **React Frontend**: PARTIAL - Has TypeScript compilation errors
- **Issues Found**:
  - `GeneratePromptResponse` unused import
  - `import.meta.env` TypeScript compatibility issues in `usePromptAPI.ts` and `api_OpenAI.ts`
- **Build Status**: Fails due to TypeScript errors

### Overall System Assessment
- **Backend System**: Operational (new OpenAI system)
- **Legacy System**: Has environment issues
- **Frontend**: Needs TypeScript fixes before migration
- **Branch Strategy**: Working as intended

## Branch Workflow for Migration

### Phase Execution Pattern
1. Ensure on `migration-experimental` branch
2. Execute phase tasks
3. Test basic functionality (document, don't fix)
4. Commit changes
5. Proceed to next phase

### Rollback Procedures
At any phase, if critical failure occurs:
1. Stop current work
2. `git checkout master`
3. Assess situation
4. Restart from beginning if needed

## Current Status

- **Branch Created**: ✅ migration-experimental
- **Branch Active**: ✅ Currently on migration-experimental
- **Safety Verified**: ✅ Can switch back to master
- **Phase 1 Complete**: ✅ Pre-migration validation complete

## Notes

- Migration follows prototyping principles (document issues, don't fix)
- Emergency recovery always available via master branch
- System state documented for future phases
