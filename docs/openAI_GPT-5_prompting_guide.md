## Core GPT-5 Prompting Principles

### 1. Structure & Organization

#### **Lead with Action**
Always start prompts with behavioral guidance:
```
Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: [Role and context]
```

#### **Hierarchical Information**
Use clear section headers in logical order:
- **Role Definition**: Who the AI is and its capabilities
- **Tools**: Available resources and data sources
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance
- **Output Format**: Specific response structure requirements

#### **Logical Flow**
Present information in order of importance:
1. Role → Tools → Instructions → Format
2. Most critical information first
3. Supporting details follow

### 2. Clarity & Specificity

#### **Explicit Instructions**
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Provide specific examples when possible
- Define technical terms and abbreviations
- Set clear boundaries and constraints

#### **Context Provision**
- Include relevant background information
- Specify timeframes and data sources
- Provide domain-specific context
- Set expectations for response depth

### 3. Output Formatting

#### **Structured Responses**
- Use consistent formatting patterns
- Implement numbered/bullet point structures
- Define maximum response lengths
- Specify required sections and subsections

#### **Financial Analysis Format**
```
KEY TAKEAWAYS:
• [Maximum 3 bullet point insights]

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. [Numbered or bullet point format]
2. [Data and analysis only]
3. [No actionable recommendations]
```

---

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. P.C.A.T.R. Framework (Microsoft PromptWizard)

The P.C.A.T.R. framework provides a structured approach to prompt optimization:

#### **Plan**
Begin with a brief plan to outline the task:
```
Plan first for this task, then execute step-by-step. Keep steps short.
```

#### **Constrain**
Set clear constraints and success criteria:
- Length limits (e.g., "Maximum 3 key insights")
- Style rules (e.g., "No actionable recommendations")
- Success criteria (e.g., "Focus on data analysis only")

#### **Artifacts**
Specify desired outputs or artifacts:
- Tables, lists, structured formats
- Specific data points to include
- Required sections and subsections

#### **Tools**
Indicate specific tools/resources to utilize:
- Data sources (e.g., "Polygon.io MCP server")
- Analysis methods (e.g., "Technical indicators")
- Available APIs and endpoints

#### **Reflect**
Encourage AI to review output for accuracy:
- Self-evaluation mechanisms
- Quality assurance checks
- Iterative improvement processes

### 2. Router Nudge Phrases

Engage GPT-5's deeper reasoning capabilities with specific phrases:

#### **Deep Reasoning Triggers**
- "Think hard about this"
- "Think deeply about this"
- "Think carefully"
- "Consider all aspects"

#### **Performance Enhancement**
These phrases trigger more nuanced, comprehensive responses:
```
Analyze the market data. Think deeply about the underlying trends and patterns.
```

### 3. XML Sandwich Structure

Organize complex prompts using XML-like tags:

#### **Clear Delineation**
```xml
<TASK>
Analyze the financial performance of Company X for Q2 2025.
</TASK>
<DATA>
[Insert financial data here]
</DATA>
<CONSTRAINTS>
- Focus on revenue growth and profit margins
- No actionable recommendations
- Maximum 3 key insights
</CONSTRAINTS>
```

#### **Benefits**
- Helps GPT-5 understand complex multi-component prompts
- Provides clear context separation
- Enables structured data input

### 4. Perfection Loop Technique

Implement self-improvement mechanisms:

#### **Internal Rubric Creation**
```
Create an internal rubric for a "world-class" financial analysis response.
```

#### **Self-Evaluation Process**
```
Grade your response against the rubric and iterate until achieving a perfect score.
```

#### **Quality Assurance**
- Ensures high-quality outputs for complex analyses
- Implements continuous improvement
- Maintains consistency across responses

### 5. Minimal Reasoning Optimization

Optimize for speed when needed:

#### **Fast Response Mode**
- Use minimal reasoning setting for time-sensitive tasks
- Compensate with ultra-clear, concise prompts
- Ideal for real-time market analysis

#### **Compensation Strategy**
```
Quick Response Needed with minimal tool calls: [Ultra-clear instructions]
```

## Financial Analysis Specific Techniques

### 1. Contextual Grounding

#### **Data-Only Analysis**
Ensure AI relies solely on provided financial documents:
```
Rely solely on the provided financial data. Do not make assumptions beyond the given context.
```

#### **No External Assumptions**
- Avoid AI making assumptions beyond provided context
- Critical for regulatory compliance
- Maintains financial accuracy

#### **Verification Requirements**
```
Verify the presence of answer text within the provided context before responding.
```

### 2. FailSafe QA Benchmarking

#### **Robustness Testing**
Evaluate AI's ability to handle imperfect queries:
- Misspellings and incomplete questions
- Noisy or incomplete data
- Ambiguous financial terminology

#### **Refusal Policy**
```
If the context is missing or irrelevant, politely refuse and state that you need the relevant document.
```

#### **Financial Compliance**
- Ensures accuracy in financial contexts
- Maintains regulatory compliance
- Prevents misleading information

### 3. Iterative Refinement Process

#### **Collaborative Approach**
Treat AI interaction as collaborative process:
1. Start with broad prompt
2. Narrow based on initial outputs
3. Refine based on feedback

#### **Progressive Narrowing**
```
1. "Provide an overview of Company X's financial performance in Q2 2025."
2. "Detail the factors contributing to the observed revenue growth."
3. "Suggest strategies to sustain this revenue growth."
```

#### **Feedback Integration**
```
Based on the provided financial analysis, are there any additional metrics you would like to explore?
```

### 4. Financial Domain Specificity

#### **Industry Terminology**
- Use precise financial language
- Include relevant financial metrics
- Specify analysis frameworks

#### **Contextual Relevance**
- Provide specific financial context
- Include market conditions and timeframes
- Specify data sources and methodologies

#### **Comparative Analysis**
- Request comparisons across periods
- Compare against industry benchmarks
- Analyze relative performance metrics

## Market Data Analysis Patterns

### 1. Real-Time Data Structure

#### **Time-Sensitive Context**
Always include current date/time for real-time analysis:
```
Current Date/Time: {datetime_context}
Use this timestamp for all market analysis.
```

#### **Data Freshness**
- Emphasize use of most recent market data
- Specify data update frequencies
- Include data source timestamps

#### **Volatility Awareness**
- Account for market volatility in analysis requests

### 2. Technical Indicator Optimization

#### **Specific Metrics**
Request specific technical indicators:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
- Volume analysis
- Momentum indicators

#### **Signal Interpretation**
Focus on signal interpretation rather than raw data:
```
Analyze the RSI signals and their implications for trend direction.
```

#### **Trend Analysis**
- Emphasize trend direction and momentum
- Include support and resistance levels
- Analyze volume confirmation

### 3. Support/Resistance Analysis

#### **Level Identification**
Focus on key price levels and their significance:
```
Identify key support and resistance levels with volume confirmation.
```

#### **Historical Context**
- Include historical support/resistance behavior
- Analyze level strength and significance
- Consider multiple timeframe analysis

#### **Volume Confirmation**
- Request volume analysis for level validation
- Include volume patterns and trends
- Analyze volume-price relationships
