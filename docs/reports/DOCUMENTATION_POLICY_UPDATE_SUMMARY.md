### 3. Documentation Organization ✅

**New Structure**:
```
/docs/
├── reports/                           # NEW: Centralized reports location
│   ├── README.md                     # NEW: Organization standards
│   ├── CRITICAL_FIXES_REPORT.md     # MOVED from root
│   ├── PRODUCTION_BUG_TESTS.md      # MOVED from root
│   ├── backend_integration_report.md # MOVED from root
│   └── DOCUMENTATION_POLICY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md # NEW: This file
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_AWS.md          # Existing
├── FEATURE_SCOPE_STOCK_DATA_GUI.md  # Existing
└── scratchpad.md                     # Existing
```

**Organization Standards**:
- Centralized location for all project reports
- Clear naming conventions and content standards
- Maintenance guidelines and cross-reference procedures
- File management protocols for active vs archived reports

## Policy Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Sequential Thinking Tool Requirements

**Tool Usage Pattern** (Required for ALL agents):
```python
# MANDATORY: Start complex task with sequential thinking
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  "thought": "Understanding the task: [analysis]",
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5
})
```

### 2. Context7 Tool Requirements

**Required Usage Pattern**:
```python
# Step 1: MANDATORY - Resolve library ID
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id({"libraryName": "gradio"})

# Step 2: MANDATORY - Get focused documentation  
mcp__context7__get-library-docs({
  "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/gradio-app/gradio",
  "topic": "async handling",
  "tokens": 2000
})
```

### 3. Testing Protocol Requirements

**Required Test Script Structure**:
- Bug reproduction testing
- Fix validation testing
- Edge case testing
- Regression prevention testing
- Production scenario testing

**Success Criteria Standards**:
- Response Parser Fixes: >90% field extraction from real AI responses
- Message History Fixes: Zero None content entries allowed
- FSM Error Recovery: Recovery in <2 seconds with user feedback
- UI Integration: Sequential button operations without errors
- Performance: No regression in response times or memory usage

## Quality Gates and Verification

### Verification Checklist for ALL Agents:
- [ ] Used `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for task analysis
- [ ] Used `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to get library ID
- [ ] Used `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research best practices
- [ ] Implemented solution using researched patterns
- [ ] Added comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Planned and documented testing approach
- [ ] Created test script for bug fixes (if applicable)
- [ ] Verified all requirements are met

### Consequences for Non-Compliance:
- ❌ Task Rejection: Work will be rejected and must be redone
- ❌ Re-delegation: Task will be reassigned to different agent
- ❌ Quality Gate Failure: Code will not pass review process
- ❌ Production Risk: Changes may cause production issues

- Quality gates ensure all requirements are met before completion
- Clear consequences framework maintains accountability
- Verification checklists provide measurable compliance criteria

## Success Metrics

The success of these policy updates will be measured by:

1. **Tool Usage Compliance**: 100% of specialist agents using required tools
2. **Testing Coverage**: All bug fixes accompanied by test scripts
3. **Production Stability**: Reduction in production bugs and system failures
4. **Documentation Quality**: Improved organization and accessibility of project documentation
5. **Code Quality**: Enhanced implementation standards through enforced research

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Monitor agent compliance with new tool usage requirements
2. **Short-term**: Validate test script creation for all future bug fixes
3. **Medium-term**: Review and refine policy effectiveness after 30 days
4. **Long-term**: Expand policy framework to cover additional development scenarios
