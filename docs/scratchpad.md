### THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED OR READ BY AI AGENTS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FOR TEMPORARY USER SCRATCHPAD AND NOTES




Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to read and follow protocol in /home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/.claude/CLAUDE_AI_TEAM.md for the new task below:

## New Task Goal: Read, Digest, & Understand proper Tech-lead-orchestrator rules for AI Team Specialists
- NO NEW DOCS NEEDED YET

## New Task Details:
1. Read, Digest, & Understand proper Tech-lead-orchestrator rules for AI Team Specialists
/home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/.claude/agents
README_AI_TEAM.md
CLAUDE_AI_TEAM.md
best-practices.md
creating-agents.md
tech-lead-orchestrator.md

2. After research from step 1, generate a generic test prompt for new tasks request that user can user to incorporate all the critical concepts and rules below and from any of the research to enforce Tech-lead-orchestrator for future task to follow it's procedure of NEVER performing any work and ONLY delegating & coordinating to Specialist for new user tasks.  Need to also enforce MCP Tool usage for every specialist that matches the task.

## Background & Context: 
- We previously have numerous issues with the Tech-lead-orchestrator not following it's protocols, such as doing work when it should not, and not executing delegation\coordination plan etc

## POST TASK ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- PAUSE for user to review the initial test prompt



## New Task Goal: Add a new Claude Code new_task "custom slash command" to the project's .claude folder for user usage

## New Task Details:
Use All MCP Tools for all task(s):
1. Perform research on how to add a new Claude Code "custom slash command" to the project's .claude folder for user usage

2. After research, create a new custom slash command "/new_task" with the following requirements:
- Generate a brand new "new_task_details.md" in top level
- Copy\Paste entire tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md into the new "/new_task" details
- Update both the tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md, and "/new_task" command details to perform task by ONLY reading task details in "new_task_details.md"
- We need to enforce that "new_task_details.md" should NOT be read on it's own unless a new task is requested, because this file may have old previous closed task details that may not be up to date with the new user task

Here is the expected flow when user invokes the new "/new_task" command:
- User inputs new task details into "new_task_details.md"
- User invokes "/new_task" command
- User invoking "new_task" will automically know to use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to execute the new task details into "new_task_details.md"
- tech-lead-orchestrator gets invoked and follows rules for the "/new_task" command, and then reads "new_task_details.md"
- Based on the analysis of "new_task_details.md", tech-lead-orchestrator creates the AI Specialist Delegation & Coordination Plan with assigned tasks for proper Specialist
- AI Specialists now starts executing the plan autonmously with MCP tool calls as needed
- Plan gets executed with Specialists until completion with no freezes\pauses from tech-lead-orchestrator


## Background & Context: 

## POST TASK ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:




- 

- I have reviewed the /docs/enhanced-openai-gpt5-migration-plan.md and it looks very light on task details

Use @tech-lead-orchestrator to Delegate & Coordinate and trigger execution of all the requested task(s) with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage for all task(s):

1. Use Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool to Review, Analyze, and update the plan again with more granular details for EACH task\sub-task
2. After doc updates, Specialist to start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING review with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage 
3. ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, use Specialist to perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT PUSH to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit
4. DO NOT FORGET TO PUSH SINCE I ALREADY PROVIDED A GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN - IF YOU DO NOT PUSH, YOU HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE ATOMIC COMMIT & PUSH!!!



Use @tech-lead-orchestrator to Delegate & Coordinate and trigger execution of all the requested task(s) with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage for all task(s):
- This is a documentation commit task ONLY - NO NEW CODE CHANGES so do NOT start the plan yet, we just want to commit the plan docs:

1. Generate new .md in docs folder for the Enhanced OpenAI GPT-5 Migration Plan with Full AI Team Coordination
2. After new doc generated with the plan, start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING review with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage 
3. ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, use Specialist to perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT PUSH to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit
4. DO NOT FORGET TO PUSH SINCE I ALREADY PROVIDED A GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN - IF YOU DO NOT PUSH, YOU HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE ATOMIC COMMIT & PUSH!!!




- DO NOT TRIGGER IMPLEMENATION OF THE PLAN YET BECAUSE IT IS PENDING USER APPROVAL - SO DO NOT START CODING TASKS YET BECAUSE USER NEEDS TO APPROVE OR REJECT

- CLAUDE.md will have the proper AI Team Specialist Assigments

- Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to use MCP Tools and review CLAUDE.md & OpenAI GPT-5 Migration Plan - Complete Feature Parity Implementation, and then analyze to add and update the plan with the fully detailed AI Team Specialist Delegation & Coordination task breakdown for User Review & Approval

- DO NOT GENERATE A NEW .MD DOC yet of the new plan because user wants to review the updated AI Team Specialist Delegation & Coordination plan

‚îÇ ‚îÇ This plan ensures zero risk to the working baseline while building a complete OpenAI GPT-5 implementation with 100% feature parity.    




## Main Claude Agent Instructions: Research, analyze, and then come with with a detailed implementation plan breakdown todo list so that the AI Specialist team can perform the requested task(s):

## Background & Context
- We previously imported and modified the base code that used Claude & Pydantic AI into a UI interface
- But now there have been updates to use Open AI ChatGPT 5 model that was recently released
- I have imported\copied the base code of the new GPT-5 Architecture into the "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp" folder

## Detailed Task Info
End Goal: Entire app completey migrated to use new OpenAI GPT-5 ecosystem and OpenAI Agents Ecosystem for BOTH Chat & UI code

1. Use Sequentual-Thinking, Filesystem, Context7 and other tools needed to scope out and provide a detailed implementation plan breakdown todo list so that the AI Specialist team can perform the full migration with following details & requirements:
- Since this is a high risk re-archtecture of the app, the migration needs to be performed in phases
- We need to keep the current code alone completely to serve as a baseline working version while the migration is in progress
- The new migration will need to have it's files\folders moved to matching top level of the project, BUT with explicit file\folder names with some kind of "xxx_openAI" label at the end so we can easily isolate and differentiate
- The OpenAI Version will have it's own completely isolated Chat Code & Chat UI code using Gradio running in parallel
- The OpenAI Migration MUST have 100% feature parity with the current legacy version - meaning we will NOT simply import the current OpenAI code and call it a day - It needs the FULL featureset and UI featureset from the legacy code
- So you will also need to make sure you properly backport\merge\migrate some of the features we added, like token counting, buttom prompts, same UI etc
- The OpenAI model to be used for the migration will be GPT-5-mini, same as existing legacy code
- If you migrated and we are missing feeatures and functionality that is not 100% parity with legacy code, then you have done it incorrectly
- With the parallel code paths, there will be initial code duplication and redududancy, but that is OK for now since we want to test BOTH OpenAI path & the normal path together to compare behavior
- NO new test files are needed for the new OpenAI path since we are just in the early stages
- There needs to be a phase where the parrallel OpenAI migration is COMPLETE, but still WITH the existing legacy code so user can start heavy testing of both apps
- Once user has thoroughly tested both paths, there also needs to be a final Phase that NOW will fully retire ALL LEGACY code, including ALL test files, where the end result is now no more parallel path and a single OpenAI Chat & UI code

## Main Claude Agent Instructions: Read, Review, & Digest new OpenAI GPT-5 Architecture for future migration task(s)
- NO NEW DOCS NEEDED FOR THIS TASK

## Background & Context
- We previously imported and modified the base code that used Claude & Pydantic AI into a UI interface
- But now there have been updates to use OpenAI GPT-5 Archtecture & OpenAI Agents SDK that was recently released
- I have imported\copied the base code of the new GPT-5 Architecture into the "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp" folder

## Detailed Task Info
End Goal: This is a prep task to first perform some homework before a future TBD task to completey migrate app to use new OpenAI GPT-5 Archtectecture & Ecosystem BOTH Chat & UI code

1. Use Sequentual-Thinking, Filesystem, and other other tools needed to Read, Review, & Digest the imported & isolated GPT-5 project files; here are some of the main ones to review:
/home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/README.md
/home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/src/main.py
/home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/pyproject.toml

After your review, PAUSE for a new task based on your understanding of the new Architecture

2. After your review, now scope out and provide a detailed implementation plan breakdown todo list so that the AI Specialist team can perform the full migration with following details & requirements:

- First, perform a git commit
- After git commit is successful, we need to enable permissions to perform the push to github repo where we may need authentication


- Based on MCP_TESTING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md, we have confirmed that ALL AI Specialist now have access to the 3x Mandatory MCP Tool
- Now review & update MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md with the confirmed support, and now we can remove the MCP tool waiver and update the guide to now enforce MCP tool usage, since we previously had a waiver because we couldnt not get all Specialist to call MCP tools, but now it works
- You will need to review latest AI Team updates in CLAUDE.md, and the MCP_TESTING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md & MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md in order to properly update optimal MCP tool usage for EACH AI Team specialist



- I have reviewed the report and approved it so we can try and close out this task
 
- Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to coordinate all of the following closing task actions:
1. Move the MCP_TESTING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md to docs/reports folder
2. Remove ALL docs generated from the MCP Tool testing.  There were at least 25 - 30 .md docs generated during the planning and execution of the MCP test plan, but they are no longer needed since we have finished the testing.  MCP_TESTING_VALIDATION_REPORT.md will be the ONLY doc that will be committed and pushed to repo
3. git commit & git push to repo



## Previous Docs have been commited; Here is new task details:

## DO NOT READ "scratchpad.md" to avoid confusion for new task(s) because that is a temporary User notepad ONLY AND NOT to be read\opened by ANY AI Coding Agent

## Background & Context: User plans on fully implementing the full Polygon API Endpoints, from the Polygon.io Python API Library, to add full endpoints support to the current used Polygon MCP Server in our project. But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker

## New User Task Details: Review, Analyze, and then merge\consolidate the 2x independent separate multi broker comparison docs into a single new consolidated .md doc , and then remove the 2x old docs

- Review, Analyze, and then merge\consolidate the 2x independent separate multi broker comparisons into a new unified single source of truth doc "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_FINAL.md"
- The single new doc should assimulate analysis from both docs to remove any dupe, redundant, incorrect etc info
- Having these 2x docs generated by different teams\methods is a "sanity check safe guard" to ensure that there are no conflicting\inaccurate\hallucinated info from 1x party, since we have 2x parties to compare:

1. "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_Main_Claude_Agent.md" was generated using Main Claude Agent with Context7 & Sequential-Thinking
2. "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_AI_TEAM.md" was generated using AI Team Specialist with NO Context7 & Sequential-Thinking


## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- Start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code\doc review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE\DOC REVIEW, and then perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit 


## Main Claude Agent Instructions:
1. First, I'll use the tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze and get routing
   ‚Üí Tech lead to follow procedures in both "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/CLAUDE.md" AND "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/agents/orchestrators/tech-lead-orchestrator.md" and then returns Agent Routing Map with SPECIFIC agents
   
2. I MUST use ONLY the agents listed in the routing map:
- If tech-lead says "use django-api-developer" ‚Üí Use that EXACT agent
- If tech-lead says "use react-component-architect" ‚Üí Use that EXACT agent
- DO NOT substitute with generic agents unless specified as fallback
   
3. Execute tasks in the order specified by tech-lead using TodoWrite

## Previous Docs have been commited; Here is new task details:

## Background & Context: User plans on fully implementing the full Polygon API Endpoints, from the Polygon.io Python API Library, to add full endpoints support to the current used Polygon MCP Server in our project. But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker.  User has active subscription for Polygon Stocks Starter ($29) & Options Starter Plan ($29), for a total cost of ~$58 per month to serve as the baseline.

## New User Task Details: "AI Team to Generate a new independent "AI Team" generated .md doc for research, investigation, and scope out the multiple alternative Brokers API Capabilities to compare to the currently used Polygon.io Broker API\Python Library 

- New single doc named will be "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_AI_TEAM.md" in /docs folder

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- Start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT PUSH to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit

## Main Claude Agent Instructions:
1. First, I'll use the tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze and get routing
   ‚Üí Tech lead to follow procedures in both "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/CLAUDE.md" AND "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/agents/orchestrators/tech-lead-orchestrator.md" and then returns Agent Routing Map with SPECIFIC agents
   
2. I MUST use ONLY the agents listed in the routing map:
- If tech-lead says "use django-api-developer" ‚Üí Use that EXACT agent
- If tech-lead says "use react-component-architect" ‚Üí Use that EXACT agent
- DO NOT substitute with generic agents unless specified as fallback
   
3. Execute tasks in the order specified by tech-lead using TodoWrite

## Previous Docs have been commited; Here is new task details:

## Background & Context: User plans on fully implementing the full Polygon API Endpoints, from the Polygon.io Python API Library, to add full endpoints support to the current used Polygon MCP Server in our project. But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker.  User has active subscription for Polygon Stocks Starter ($29) & Options Starter Plan ($29), for a total cost of ~$58 per month to serve as the baseline.

## New User Task Details: "Main Claude Agent to Use Context7 and Sequential-Thinking to Generate a new "Main Claude Agent" generated .md doc for research, investigation, and scope out the hybrid multiple alternative Brokers API Capabilities to compare to the currently used Polygon.io Broker API\Python Library to come up with up to 2x Broker APIs at the same time, so each 1x Broker covers the gap from the 2nd broker: 

- New single doc named will be "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_Main_Claude_Agent.md" in /docs folder
- This Phase 1 independent document will be generated by using Main Claude Agent with Context7 & Sequential-Thinking
- An additional phase will be performed later on using AI Team TBD
- Use any potential Brokers that match our current app and looks comparable to current Polygon.  Avoid ETRADE & IBKR since we already anlayzed those.  User wants any other possible alternative choices besides Polygon, ETRADE, and IBKR

- The research needs to have a dedicated analysis section for EACH potential Broker, that will EACH have analysis for ALL of the following:

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
Use @tech-lead-orchestrator to Delegate & Coordinate and trigger execution of all the requested task(s) with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage for all task(s):

1. Generate new .md in docs folder for the Enhanced OpenAI GPT-5 Migration Plan with Full AI Team Coordination
2. After new doc generated with the plan, start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING review with Sequential-Thinking, Context7, & Filesystem Tool Usage 
3. ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, use Specialist to perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT PUSH to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit
4. DO NOT FORGET TO PUSH SINCE I ALREADY PROVIDED A GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN - IF YOU DO NOT PUSH, YOU HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE ATOMIC COMMIT & PUSH!!!
