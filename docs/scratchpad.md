[GPT-5] feat: Enhance Chatbot UI for cross platform dynamic sizing display

## Task Description

Task 1. Perform Research & generate a plan to implement the requested new OpenAI GPT-5 Chat UI feature(s) for multiple platforms: Mobile, Desktop, iPad, etc:
A. Chatbot Responses: Dynamic vertical & horizontal scrollbars & word wrapping for displaying across multiple platforms

B. Chatbot User Request: Dynamic vertical & horizontal scrollbars, word wrapping, and increase default input to be at least 4x lines instead of a single line input textbox for displaying across multiple platforms

Task 2. Based on the research & plan from Task 1, implement the plan

MANDATORY FINAL CLOSING TASK(S): Review\Fix Loop, Doc Updates, Atomic Git Commit & Push, & Final Verification

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must push to complete the workflow - commit without push is incomplete

### Step 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly committed and pushed

**Key Requirements:**

- Single atomic commit prevents code vs documentation separation
- All changes (code + docs + summary) must be committed together
- Task summary generation occurs BEFORE git commit to ensure inclusion
- Automated workflow ensures consistency and completeness

claude "I am planning on adding a REACT based frontend end for the Chatbot UI, but still keeping the current backend using Python. Use @agent-team-configurator and optimize my project to best use the available subagents and to also add REACT front end, so we will also need the React Specialists even though the current code does not use React YET, but it will on future task"

There are old outdated requirements such as "35% cost reduction, 40% speed improvement, full-stack resource monitoring".  It is TOO early to be worrying about performance improvements at the moment since we are still Prototyping & testing. Use @agent-team-configurator and optimize my project to best use the available subagents with the removal of the "35% cost reduction, 40% speed improvement, full-stack resource monitoring" goals, so we may have to remove specialist(s) and update AI team to remove that goal that is no longer relevant.

Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to review, analyze, and implement the following:

## New Task Goal: Add a new Claude Code new_task "custom slash command" to the project's .claude folder for user usage

## New Task Details

Use All MCP Tools for all task(s):

1. Perform research on how to add a new Claude Code "custom slash command" to the project's .claude folder for user usage

2. After research, create a new custom slash command "/new_task" with the following requirements:

- Generate a brand new "new_task_details.md" in top level
- Copy\Paste entire tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md into the new "/new_task" details
- Update both the tech-lead-orchestrator-enforcement-test-prompt.md, and "/new_task" command details to perform task by ONLY reading task details in "new_task_details.md"
- We need to enforce that "new_task_details.md" should NOT be read on it's own unless a new task is requested, because this file may have old previous closed task details that may not be up to date with the new user task

Here is the expected flow when user invokes the new "/new_task" command:

- User inputs new task details into "new_task_details.md"
- User invokes "/new_task" command
- User invoking "new_task" will automically trigger and ask  @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to follows rules for the "/new_task" command, reads "new_task_details.md" for the task details
- Based on the analysis of "new_task_details.md", tech-lead-orchestrator creates the AI Specialist Delegation & Coordination Plan with assigned tasks for proper Specialist
- AI Specialists now starts executing the plan autonmously with MCP tool calls as needed
- Plan gets executed with Specialists until completion with no freezes\pauses from tech-lead-orchestrator
- End result is that after initial agent-tech-lead-orchestrator analysis and delegation\coordination plan, ALL tasks will be performed by the appropriate Specialist(s) ONLY
  âŽ¿  Plan: Enhance OpenAI GPT-5 Chat UI for Cross-Platform Dynamic Sizing Display

     Research Summary

     Based on my analysis of the current implementation:

     Current Issues Found:
     1. Input field: Single-line <input> element - no multi-line support or dynamic resizing
     2. Message display: Fixed max-width: 70% causes horizontal overflow on mobile devices
     3. Messages container: Only vertical scrolling (overflow-y: auto), no horizontal scrollbar management
     4. No responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

     Gradio Reference Insights:
  - Uses lines=3 for multi-line text input (3 lines minimum)
  - Uses height=400 for chat display with dynamic scrollbars
  - Provides better cross-platform support

     Implementation Plan

     Phase 1: Enhanced Multi-line Input Component

     File: ChatInput_OpenAI.tsx

     Changes:

     1. Replace <input> with <textarea>
       - Default 4 lines height (rows={4})
       - Auto-resize based on content
       - Dynamic vertical scrollbar when content exceeds max height
     2. Add auto-resize functionality:
     const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
       setInputValue(e.target.value);
       // Auto-resize logic
       e.target.style.height = 'auto';
       e.target.style.height = Math.min(e.target.scrollHeight, 200) + 'px';
     };

     3. Support Shift+Enter for new lines, Enter to send:
     const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
       if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) {
         e.preventDefault();
         handleSubmit(e);
       }
     };

     Phase 2: Responsive Message Display

     Files: ChatMessage_OpenAI.tsx, ChatInterface_OpenAI.tsx

     Changes:

     1. Dynamic message bubble width with responsive breakpoints:
     .message-bubble {
       max-width: 85%; /*Mobile */
       overflow-x: auto; /* Horizontal scroll when needed*/
       overflow-y: visible;
       word-wrap: break-word;
       overflow-wrap: break-word;
     }

     @media (min-width: 768px) {
       .message-bubble {
         max-width: 70%; /*Tablet/Desktop*/
       }
     }

     2. Enhanced message container with proper scrollbar management:
     .messages-container {
       flex: 1;
       overflow-y: auto; /*Vertical scroll always */
       overflow-x: hidden; /* Prevent horizontal scroll on container*/
       padding: 16px;
       width: 100%;
       max-width: 100%;
     }

     /*Mobile-specific adjustments*/
     @media (max-width: 767px) {
       .messages-container {
         padding: 8px;
         max-width: 100vw;
       }
     }

     3. Code block handling for horizontal overflow:
     .message-content pre {
       overflow-x: auto;
       max-width: 100%;
       white-space: pre;
     }

     .message-content code {
       word-break: break-word;
     }

     Phase 3: Cross-Platform Optimizations

     1. Touch-friendly scrollbars for mobile:

     /*Larger scrollbars on touch devices*/
     @media (hover: none) {
       ::-webkit-scrollbar {
         width: 10px;
         height: 10px;
       }
     }

     2. Viewport meta tag optimization (if not present):

     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">

     3. Platform-specific input enhancements:

  - iOS: Prevent zoom on input focus
  - Android: Handle keyboard resize events
  - Desktop: Enhanced mouse wheel scrolling

     Phase 4: Dynamic Scrollbar Visibility

     Smart scrollbar display (only when needed):

     /*Show scrollbars only when content overflows */
     .message-bubble {
       overflow-x: auto;
       overflow-y: auto;
       scrollbar-width: thin; /* Firefox*/
     }

     /*Hide scrollbars when not needed */
     .message-bubble:not(:hover) {
       scrollbar-width: none; /* Firefox*/
     }

     .message-bubble:not(:hover)::-webkit-scrollbar {
       display: none; /*Chrome/Safari*/
     }

     /*Show on hover/focus*/
     .message-bubble:hover,
     .message-bubble:focus-within {
       scrollbar-width: thin;
     }

     Files to Modify:

     1. ChatInput_OpenAI.tsx - Convert to multi-line textarea with auto-resize
     2. ChatMessage_OpenAI.tsx - Add responsive message bubble sizing and overflow handling
     3. ChatInterface_OpenAI.tsx - Update container styles for better responsive layout
     4. index.css - Add global responsive utilities and platform-specific optimizations

     Testing Requirements:

     1. Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) - Test touch scrolling and input
     2. Tablets (iPad Safari, Android tablets) - Test landscape/portrait modes
     3. Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - Test window resizing
     4. Long content - Test with messages containing code blocks, long text
     5. Keyboard navigation - Ensure accessibility maintained

     Success Criteria:

     âœ… Multi-line input with 4+ lines default height
     âœ… Auto-resizing input based on content
     âœ… Horizontal scrollbars only appear when needed
     âœ… Vertical scrollbars for both input and messages when needed
     âœ… Responsive layout works on all screen sizes
     âœ… No horizontal page scrolling on mobile
     âœ… Smooth scrolling experience across platforms
     âœ… Maintains existing functionality (copy buttons, export, etc.)

     MANDATORY POST-TASK ACTIONS:

     Following implementation, will execute:
     1. Code review with security & quality assessment
     2. Update CLAUDE.md with task summary
     3. Atomic git commit & push
