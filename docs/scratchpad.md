# New Task Details

## Task Description

Implement Frontend GUI Restructuring Plan to consolidate ticker inputs & create a static, well-organized GUI layout

## Research Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## 1. Consolidate Ticker Input

- Create a new `SharedTickerInput` component that will be the single source of ticker input for all buttons
- Remove individual ticker inputs from each `AnalysisButton` component
- Set default ticker to "NVDA" as requested
- Pass the shared ticker value from parent component to all buttons

## 2. Restructure GUI Layout

The new static structure will be:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        AI CHATBOT SECTION           │ (Top - always visible)
│  - Chat messages                    │
│  - User input textbox               │
│  - Send button                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       USER INPUTS SECTION           │ (Middle - extras)
│  - Shared Ticker Input Box          │
│  - Space for future inputs          │
│    (Options Chain Expirations, etc) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     BUTTON PROMPTS SECTION          │ (Bottom - grid layout)
│  ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐       │
│  │Button│ │Button│ │Button│        │
│  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘       │
│  (Expandable grid for 10+ buttons) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Key Implementation Changes

### `ChatInterface_OpenAI.tsx`

- Move chat interface to always be at the top
- Create dedicated sections with fixed positions
- Prevent buttons from overlapping chat area
- Ensure layout remains static during all app states

### New `SharedTickerInput` Component

- Single input field with NVDA default
- Validation for minimum 3 characters
- Real-time uppercase conversion
- Controls all button states

### `AnalysisButton` Refactoring

- Remove individual ticker inputs
- Receive ticker value from parent via props
- Disable buttons when ticker < 3 characters
- Use shared ticker for all prompts

### CSS Updates

- Fixed positioning for each section
- Grid layout for buttons (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
- No layout shifts during runtime
- Consistent spacing and styling

## 4. Validation & Features

- Buttons disabled when ticker input has < 3 characters
- Real-time validation with visual feedback
- Ticker automatically uppercased and cleaned (alphanumeric only)
- All buttons use the same ticker source
- Room for future user input fields in dedicated section

## 5. Benefits

- **No more layout jumping** - fixed positions for all sections
- **Single ticker source** - eliminates confusion and inconsistency
- **Better UX** - clean separation of chatbot and extras
- **Scalable** - grid layout supports 10+ future buttons
- **Maintainable** - clear component boundaries and responsibilities

This plan will resolve the current issues of:

- Multiple ticker inputs causing confusion
- Layout elements moving during app startup vs runtime
- Buttons covering the AI chat interface
- Poor organization of UI components

## Planning Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s):

This implementation will provide a robust, consistent development environment with true one-click startup!

## Implementation Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown, perform the requested todo checklist task(s)

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**
