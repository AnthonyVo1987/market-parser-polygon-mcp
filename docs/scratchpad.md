### THIS FILE IS A TEMPORARY SCRATCHPAD FOR USER TO JOT DOWN NOTES; AI AGENTS SUCH AS CLAUDE, GEMINI ETC SHOULD NOT OPEN OR READ THIS FILE TO PREVENT CONTEXT POLLUTION ###

● You can continue this chat session later by using Claude Code's session management features. Here are the key approaches:

  1. Session Recovery via Chat History

  Claude Code automatically maintains your chat history. If the session crashes/freezes:

- Restart Claude Code - Your conversation history is preserved
- Use /context - Shows current session state and memory usage (as you just did)
- Chat history persists - All previous messages and context remain available

  2. Project State Documentation

  Your current progress is well-documented in the repository:

  Key Files to Reference

- CLAUDE.md - Contains the current project state and last completed task summary
- LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md - Detailed documentation of Phase 3-4 completion
- docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md - Shows migration progress (Phases 1-4 complete)

  Current State Summary

- Branch: migration-experimental
- Completed: Phases 1-4 (50% migration progress)
- Tag: v0.0.4 marking legacy system removal completion
- Next Phase: Phase 5 ready for implementation

  3. Recovery Commands

  If you need to resume from a crash:

# Check current status

  git status
  git branch --show-current

# Verify migration progress  

  git log --oneline -3
  git tag -l

# Read current state

  cat CLAUDE.md | grep -A 20 "LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START"

  4. Session Continuation Strategy

  To pick up where we left off:

  1. Run /resync - This will read all project documentation and restore context
  2. Check new_task_details.md - Update it with the next phase you want to implement
  3. Run /new_task - Continue with the next migration phase

  5. Current Session Status

  Based on your /context output:

- Token Usage: 68% (136k/200k) - Still plenty of capacity
- Memory: 9.9k tokens in project memory
- MCP Tools: Fully available
- Agents: All specialists ready

  The session is currently healthy and can continue. The comprehensive documentation in your repository ensures you can always recover the exact state and continue from Phase 5
  implementation whenever needed.

  TASK STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITH EXCELLENCE

  The complete Playwright testing slash command system is now operational, fully documented, and ready for production use by all team members.

Sanity Check #8: Use Sequential-Thinking Tools & Filesystem Tools to perform another Doc Review of gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md

  1. Can AI Agent fully replicate the entire test sequence and test report from playwright_CLI_test_25-09-10_18-30.md by JUST reading PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md?  If not, fix Fix
  PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md until PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md can fully replicate the entire test sequence and test report from playwright_CLI_test_25-09-10_18-30.md.

  2. Can AI Agent fully replicate the entire test sequence and test report from  playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_16-35.md by JUST reading PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md? If not, fix Fix
  PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md until PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md can fully replicate the entire test sequence and test report from playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_16-35.md

  3. After performing fixes, wait for user review and feedback - do NOT commit anything yet\

  Wait, let's get something straight first:

Answer some questions first:

- We don't need backward compatilbility with the reports since with the new changes, we will test out and generate new reports to verify it follows the new rules
- Don't need the new timing mapping etc
- For the CLI COmmand mismatch, which command is better for us?  THe Master plan command is more complex but thats with Context7 research recommendation so maybe the master plan command is better?  please confirm this first

  Adjust the plan again with the following:
- ALL Tasks require sequential-thinking tool usage
- CLI Method updates requires Context7 Tool to make sure we are working with the most update to date robust Playwright CLI NPX Methods & sequential-thinking tool
- MCP Method updates requires Context7 Tool to make sure we are working with the most update to date robust Playwright MCP Tool Call Methods & sequential-thinking tool

Add on further updates and adjustments for MCP Method:

- Add detailed Playwright MCP Tool calls, usage, syntax, inputs, outputs for EACH of the tests
- The reason is other AI Agents may not realize the proper usage of the PLaywright MCP Tools in order to perform the test(s), so we need to add more granular details to spell out what is the proper Playwright MCP tool calls for
- End result is the MCP Method Master Plan for EACH test has all the proper details needed for an AI Agent that has NEVER used Playwright MCP Tools before, to properly utilize the tools for proper test
- AI Agents may not know what tools to call, what to input, what output to expect, they may call the wrong tools, or even call proper tools but the parameters are incorrect etc

Playwright MCP Tool Call Usage and\or Parameters for:

- Starting a test matching the test's requirements
- Proper Response Polling every 10s vs 120s max timeout detection
- Response Detection
- Proper Reponse verification for Pass\Fail Criteria

In addition to the issues you flagged, lets make some updates & adjustments to the testings process, config, rules, pass\fail criteria, performance criteria, and how test results should be interpreted for CLI vs MCP method since there are inherent different requirements for each method:

- MCP Method inherently takes longer to respond per test, so it is expected to be slower than CLI Method
- We will not flag and\or focus on Performance Issues at this time, since we are prototpying.  Just add notes regarding performance for the test report.  So performance issues are now NOT part of a test's Pass\Fail criteria

1. BOTH Methods will share the following Common Criteria for EACH test:

- PASS: Test responds  AND within 120s max test timeout, regardless of performance
- FAIL: Test responds incorrectly and\or responds longer than max test timeout and\or never responds at all (timeout)
- PERFORMANCE: Categorize by 3 buckets now, with an emoji for each of the 3x different buckets:
- Good: Responds within 30s
- OK: Responds within 60s
- Slow: Responds longer than 60s but less than the 120s max timeout

2. CLI Method Only Adjustments:

- Polling time for responses is 100ms by default for CLI Method; does NOT need to poll every 30 sec like MPC Method does.  So do NOT flag 100 ms polling time as a config failure for CLI method

3. MCP Method

- Polling time for responses adjusted lower to every 10 sec, down from 30s to allow better performance measurement granularity.  Flag polling time config issue if it is NOT 10 sec polling time

# New Task Details

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

## Task Description

[Playwright CLI Method Test Request]

Use Sequential-Thinking Tool as many times as needed & Filesystem Tool(s) as many times as needed to TO PERFORM ALL TASK(S)

- Run ALL tests from gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright using Playwright CLI Method with details below:
- test-b001 through test-b016, 16x total tests to be ran for full 100% test coverage

Task 1. Review testing procedures again before starting & acknowledge: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md

Task 2. Main Agent: Review Full test plan from gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright

Task 3. Main Agent: Review previous passing PLaywright MCP Method test results that ran the full 16x tests: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_16-35.md

Task 3. Main Agent: Kill all dev servers for fresh test run

Task 4. Main Agent: Use the requested Playwright [CLI vs MCP] Method to Run the requested Tests following the procedure & format from: "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_16-35.md" & perform the test plan by marking off each TODO Test Task:
☐ Kill all existing dev servers for fresh test run
☐ Start fresh backend server (FastAPI)
☐ Start fresh frontend server (Vite)
☐ Verify both servers operational before testing
☐ Execute TEST B001 - Market Status Check using Playwright CLI

☐ Use @documentation-specialist to generate comprehensive test report

Task 5. Main Agent: CRITICAL SHORT CIRCUIT CHECK TO CONFIRM 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE: Sanity Check that ALL 16x Tests were ran:

- If 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE, Proceed to Task 6.
- If NOT 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE, TASK COMPLETETY FAILED, PROVIDE A POST-MORTEM ANALYSIS (NO DOCS NEEDS) WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WAIT FOR USER REVIEW

Task 6. ONLY After all 16/16 tests have completed running for FULL test coverage, use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_16-35.md"
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs to have it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run & also include the specific test file names\file locations for EACH test
5. Detect the current REAL world date and Pacific timestamp for the report file name *I.E. YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md: 25-09-10_13-45 for Sept 10, 2025 at 1:45 PM Pacific etc*
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format, depending if Playwright MCP and\or Playwright CLI method was used to the the tests: "playwright_MCP_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md" vs "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 7. After Task 6 is complete, wait for User to review the test results report

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s):

Task 5. [Specialist] Based on all research, analysis, & investigation, fix all the issues

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist:

## Testing Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- After fixes are implemented,

[Specialist] After all tests completed running, generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_mcp_comprehensive_test_execution_report_2025-01-10_12-37-45.md"
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs to have it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run & also include the specific test file names\file locations for EACH test
5. Detect the current REAL world date and Pacific timestamp for the report file name *I.E. YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md: 25-09-10_13-45 for Sept 10, 2025 at 1:45 PM Pacific etc*
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format, depending if Playwright MCP and\or Playwright CLI method was used to the the tests: "playwright_MCP_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md" vs "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 4. After all tests completed running, Use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_CLI_test_2025-09-10_11-39.md"
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs to have it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run & also include the specific test file names\file locations for EACH test
5. Detect the current real world date and Pacific timestamp
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format, depending if Playwright MCP and\or Playwright CLI method was used to the the tests: "playwright_MCP_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md" vs "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 5. Commit & Push to repo the single test report result doc

[CLI_TEST] Fix CLI Button Test Issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

1. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/CLI_BUTTON_TESTS_EXECUTION_RESULTS.md
2. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
3. Based on analysis from 2x test reports, research potential root cause(s) & potential fix(es)

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist:

5. Fix ALL issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
6. After fixing ALL issues, re-run the same exact tests to validate the fix(es) from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
7. If ANY tests fail, need to start the fix\test loop all over again until we get full passing test results from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
