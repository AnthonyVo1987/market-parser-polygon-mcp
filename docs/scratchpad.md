## High Level Task Goal: [PYTEST] Comprehensive Test Script Testing
## Task Context & Background:
- MANDATORY MCP TOOL USE FOR SEQUENTIAL THINKING & CONTEXT7 to properly research and breakdown all the task(s)
- The plan MUST come from @Tech-Lead-Orchestrator after some initial investigation
- Use any other MCP Tools on an as needed basis to match the task(s)

## Task Details \ Issue Symptoms:
- Perform comprehensive testing of ALL our test scripts using the newly setup pytest ecosystem to check out all of our scripts for any issues that need fixing, along with any code issues found from test scripts

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- SPECIALIST to perform Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, SPECIALIST to perform automous doc updates, git status,  and then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes 
- User will then start testing out the new changes



Have @Tech-Lead-Orchestrator follow CLAUDE.md & use SEQUENTIAL THINKING TOOL& & CONTEXT7 to generate a comprehensive plan for delegation & coordination of for the requested task(s):

## High Level Task Goal: [BUG] 3x Attempts to Fix Incorrect FSM State Transitions Preventing Subsequent Button Prompt Actions

## Task Context & Background:
- MANDATORY MCP TOOL USE FOR SEQUENTIAL THINKING & CONTEXT7 TO research the correct proper fixes and fix plan

## Task Details \ Issue Symptoms:
- THIS IS THE 4TH ATTEMPT to fix this issue so that means all of your previous premise is incorrect and you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the true root cause
- We need to ESCALALTE into a deeper dive investigation
- First perform a true root cause analysis and provide confidence percentage that you did find the real root cause, and User will review your root cause analysis and your plan to fix to see if you really found the real issue
- That means you may have been trying to fix symptoms 3x times incorrectly instead of the real root cause
- You can review previous fixes for this issue to see what failed and to see how they literally have done nothing to fix the dependency issue
- So you need to investigate this with a completely different approach and lens since you may have tunnel vision and no truly understand the underlying issue previously
- User issued Stock Snapshot Button Prompt successfully with outputs in both AI Chat and Raw JSON
- But subsequent actions for Support & Resistance & Technical Analysis are BLOCKED and fail after the initial button prompt press
- App data, such as all raw JSON data gets incorrecttly wiped out, such as Snap Shot Raw Data, even though the subsequent actions have nothing to do with Snapshot data
- This issues was supposed to be previously fixed to remove dependencies between actions, but seems like there could be a fundamental misunderstanding\premise for this issues for the previous non-working fixes
- All app actions, such as button prompts and even user input prompts MUST be independent from each other, because each action is not dependenent on another action, so there could be fundamental FSM issue
- Add more debug message outputs so when User tries to test the new fixes, we can see if the code is doing what is expected with the new fixes or not to verify what's going on under the hood

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- SPECIALIST to perform Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP AND PAUSE AND User will then start testing out the new changes to confirm if the issue have been truly fixed or not, since this is 3+ times you attempted to fix it
- We will NOT perform any doc updates and commits yet until user approved since you failed 3x previous times to fix it; we can't commit in ANOTHER non-functional fix


- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, SPECIALIST to perform automous doc updates, git status,  and then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes 
- User will then start testing out the new changes
