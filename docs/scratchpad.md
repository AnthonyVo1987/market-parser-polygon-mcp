### THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED OR READ BY AI AGENTS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FOR TEMPORARY USER SCRATCHPAD AND NOTES



claude "[feat] Use @Tech-Lead-Orchestrator to follow CLAUDE.md to scope out a plan for the delegation and coordination for Specialists perform the task(s) in new_task.md"

- I interrupted this bug fix because after reviewing the critical bug analysis report, its not a bug but more of an architectural issue
- Let's re-architect the button prompts and structured UI display with new behavior as follows:

- Button Prompt should now NEVER OUTPUT into the chat box area.  Chatbox is now ONLY reserved for user input queries to decouple it from button prompts
- Button Prompts should now ONLY Output response in structured JSON output
- Button prompts should now have explicit raw JSON output textboxes for EACH button prompt. So for example, we have 3x button prompts now, so each of those needs it's own deterministic JSN raw output response for viewing
- Once a button prompt has a successfuly raw JSON ouput, now the App's UI code can parse the raw JSON output as an intermediate step, and THEN the structured UI data can be displayed
- This sill streamline the process by inserting an intermediate raw JSON response parsing step first, and THEN the UI can be updated with the proper parsed\extracted content
- FSM States, Flags, and variables may have to be updated to handle all the new behavior
- Add new debug logs to help debug the new feature and to also output the raw JSON reponses too in the logs for easier debugging
- update test scripts
- With the new raw JSON output payload boxes, now we have visiblity on what the real response is, and to always have a unified output format for easier UI Parsing and Extraction



## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM ONLY AFTER PASSING CODE REVIEW OF ALL CODE\DOC CHANGES:
- SPECIALIST to perform git status and then an automous ATOMIC commit and push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW
- User will then start testing out the new changes



## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM ONLY AFTER CHANGES
- SPECIALIST to Start an Code\Doc Review and Fix Loop until we get a passing code review
- If PASSING code review, SPECIALIST to perform git status and then an automous ATOMIC commit and push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes
- User will then start testing out the new changes
##




Scope out and update the scope doc to enforce a "single source of truth FSM (Finite State Machine)"
- Current scope already has some state management, but let's make it a full on deterministic FSM
- So research the best practices to implement a FSM according to our app's architecture, app stack, and the scope doc details


- Update the entire implementation plan with the updated details

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM ONLY AFTER CHANGES
- Start an automous Code\Doc Review and Fix Loop until we get a passing code review
- If PASSING code review, perform an autonomous ATOMIC git commit and push to the repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes
- User will then start testing the code



###




 the feasibility, complexity, and initial implementation plan and task breakdown for new potential feature with the following details:

USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING, CONTEXT7, AND ANY OTHER TOOL CALLS AS NEEDED TO ENSURE MOST UP TO DATE AND ROBUST BEST PRACTICES

## High Level Goal: Scope new feat: Add GUI elements to be update\populated with data from certain new AI prompts actions


## Details

1. Add GUI elements that will be later updated and populated with data from responses:
- Stock Snapshot
- Support & Resistance Levels - 3 levels EACH
- Technical Analysis - RSI, MACD, EMA 5\10\20\50\200, SMA 5\10\20\50\200

2. Add some Button Prompts that user can click that will insert in specific Prompts for the AI Agent Chat:
- Current Stock Snapshot
- Support & Resistance Levels - 3 levels EACH
- Technical Analysis - RSI, MACD, EMA 5\10\20\50\200, SMA 5\10\20\50\200

3. After a button prompt is completed with a proper chat response, the app\ai agent etc now needs to update the corresponding GUI elements with the response data

4. ONLY the button prompts are allowed to update the new GUI elements. Any other chat interactions from user will NOT trigger the new gui updates

5. Generate a new.md doc in the docs folder for the new scoping details

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM ONLY AFTER CHANGES
- Start an automous Code\Doc Review and Fix Loop until we get a passing code review
- If PASSING code review, perform an autonomous ATOMIC git commit and push to the repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes
- User will then start testing the changes
