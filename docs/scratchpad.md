THESE ARE THE ONLY MCP SERVERS YOU HAVE.  You even detected them. Even teh MPC server guide these are the only 4x MCP servers you have!.  So 2x tools PER mcp server

* Internal thought processes: sequential-thinking
* Research and documentation retrieval: context7
* File system operations: filesystem
* Browser automation and interaction with web interfaces: playwright

Read the follow project docs ONE AT A TIME and acknowledge project state, last completed task(s), operating rules, & MCP Tool PRIMARY use FIRST, before I assign some new task(s):

* CLAUDE.md
* LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md
* MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

* IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
* Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

* Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist:

5. Create new CLI Button Tests to match docs/test_reports/playwright_mcp_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
6. Run new CLI Button Tests, fixing any issues in test scripts, & saving report based on same format of docs/test_reports/playwright_mcp_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

* Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
* Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
* Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
* Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

* Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
* Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
* Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
* This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

* Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
* Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
* the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
* git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
* **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

* Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
* Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
* Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**
*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

## Requirements

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

## Expected Outcome*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

* ALL new CLI Button Tests results match with parity to MCP method results: docs/test_reports/playwright_mcp_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
* Both Playwright Testing for CLI AND MCP Methods wil now have complete 100% Parity for Basic Tests & Button tests, where if we run both methods, test reports should have the same results and testing methodology and no deviations
* All code fixes, doc updates, test reports, and 6/6 test ALL PASS and everything is committed and pushed atomically

## Additional Context

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*
