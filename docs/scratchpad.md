### THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED OR READ BY AI AGENTS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FOR TEMPORARY USER SCRATCHPAD AND NOTES



Ask @Tech-Lead-Orchestrator to use SEQUENTIAL THINKING TOOL& & CONTEXT7 to generate a comprehensive plan for delegation & coordination of for the requested task(s):

## High Level Task Goal: [feat] Remove JSON Structured Output

## Task Context & Background:
- MANDATORY MCP TOOL USE FOR SEQUENTIAL THINKING & CONTEXT7 to research the correct proper fixes and fix plan

## Task Details \ Issue Symptoms:
- We are still having some issues with the JSON output format for "⚠️ Could not extract structured data from response"
- So to simplify the app even more, let's steamline and unify and have a single AI Chat request\response to remove the structured output JSON
- Let's also enhance and enforce ALL AI Chat responses to be more user viewing friendly style to output with more emojis, blank spaces, new lines, bulleted\numbered list etc
- The end result is now the App goes back toa a full on "AI Chatbot" mode with default AI Chatbox requests and responses without needing to do any structured outputs or response formatting\parsing\extraction

For reference, here is the new expected app behavior:
1. Button Prompt displays verbatim the prompt text which is current behavior
2. Buton Prompt output into AI Chatbox with no more JSON attempt, just default chat response behavior matching User Input Prompts

- The JSON structured output will be shelved for the time being to be re-visited at a later point since there are still lingering issues
- Update whatever else is needed with the unified AI Chatbox, such as test scripts, FSM, docs, etc

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- PAUSE BEFORE CODE REVIEW SO USER CAN ASSIGN SPECIAL CODE REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE PROCEEDING

- SPECIALIST to perform Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP AND PAUSE AND User will then start testing out the new changes to confirm if the issue have been truly fixed or not
- We will NOT perform any doc updates and commits yet until user approved since you failed 3x previous times to fix it; we can't commit in ANOTHER non-functional fix


- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, SPECIALIST to perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit 
- User will then start testing out the new changes

- This will be a checkpoint commit for the User to start testing later to verify if the fixes actually work
