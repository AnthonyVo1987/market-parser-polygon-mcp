# New Task Details

## Task Description

Implement Frontend GUI Restructuring Plan to consolidate ticker inputs & create a static, well-organized GUI layout

## Research Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## 1. Consolidate Ticker Input

* Create a new `SharedTickerInput` component that will be the single source of ticker input for all buttons
* Remove individual ticker inputs from each `AnalysisButton` component
* Set default ticker to "NVDA" as requested
* Pass the shared ticker value from parent component to all buttons

## 2. Restructure GUI Layout

The new static structure will be:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        AI CHATBOT SECTION           │ (Top - always visible)
│  - Chat messages                    │
│  - User input textbox               │
│  - Send button                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       USER INPUTS SECTION           │ (Middle - extras)
│  - Shared Ticker Input Box          │
│  - Space for future inputs          │
│    (Options Chain Expirations, etc) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     BUTTON PROMPTS SECTION          │ (Bottom - grid layout)
│  ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐       │
│  │Button│ │Button│ │Button│        │
│  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘       │
│  (Expandable grid for 10+ buttons) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Key Implementation Changes

### `ChatInterface_OpenAI.tsx`

* Move chat interface to always be at the top
* Create dedicated sections with fixed positions
* Prevent buttons from overlapping chat area
* Ensure layout remains static during all app states

### New `SharedTickerInput` Component

* Single input field with NVDA default
* Validation for minimum 3 characters
* Real-time uppercase conversion
* Controls all button states

### `AnalysisButton` Refactoring

* Remove individual ticker inputs
* Receive ticker value from parent via props
* Disable buttons when ticker < 3 characters
* Use shared ticker for all prompts

### CSS Updates

* Fixed positioning for each section
* Grid layout for buttons (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
* No layout shifts during runtime
* Consistent spacing and styling

## 4. Validation & Features

* Buttons disabled when ticker input has < 3 characters
* Real-time validation with visual feedback
* Ticker automatically uppercased and cleaned (alphanumeric only)
* All buttons use the same ticker source
* Room for future user input fields in dedicated section

## 5. Benefits

* **No more layout jumping** - fixed positions for all sections
* **Single ticker source** - eliminates confusion and inconsistency
* **Better UX** - clean separation of chatbot and extras
* **Scalable** - grid layout supports 10+ future buttons
* **Maintainable** - clear component boundaries and responsibilities

This plan will resolve the current issues of:

* Multiple ticker inputs causing confusion
* Layout elements moving during app startup vs runtime
* Buttons covering the AI chat interface
* Poor organization of UI components

## Planning Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
* Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s):

This implementation will provide a robust, consistent development environment with true one-click startup!

## Implementation Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown, perform the requested todo checklist task(s)

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

* SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
* Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
* Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
* Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

* Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
* Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
* Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
* This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

* Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
* Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
* the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
* git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
* **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

* Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
* Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
* Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

*All Files, Docs atomically commited after all tasks are complete*
