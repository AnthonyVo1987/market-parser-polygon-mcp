### THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED OR READ BY AI AGENTS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FOR TEMPORARY USER SCRATCHPAD AND NOTES



## Previous Docs have been commited; Here is new task details:

## Background & Context: User plans on fully implementing the full Polygon API Endpoints, from the Polygon.io Python API Library, to add full endpoints support to the current used Polygon MCP Server in our project. But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker.  User has active subscription for Polygon Stocks Starter ($29) & Options Starter Plan ($29), for a total cost of ~$58 per month to serve as the baseline.

## New User Task Details: "Main Claude Agent to Use Context7 and Sequential-Thinking to Generate a new "Main Claude Agent" generated .md doc for research, investigation, and scope out the multiple alternative Brokers API Capabilities to compare to the currently used Polygon.io Broker API\Python Library: 

- New single doc named will be "MULTI_BROKER_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_Main_Claude_Agent.md" in /docs folder
- This Phase 1 independent document will be generated by using Main Claude Agent with Context7 & Sequential-Thinking
- An additional phase will be performed later on using AI Team TBD
- Use any potential Brokers that match our current app and looks comparable to current Polygon.  Avoid ETRADE & IBKR since we already anlayzed those.  User wants any other possible alternative choices besides Polygon, ETRADE, and IBKR

- The research needs to have a dedicated analysis section for EACH potential Broker, that will EACH have analysis for ALL of the following:                                                              
- API Key\Token Authorization Complexity (Polygon is gold standard just needing an API key and no extra authorization steps needed)
- Price Comparison - User has active subscription for Polygon Stocks Starter ($29) & Options Starter Plan ($29), for a total cost of ~$58 per month to serve as the baseline
- API\Method Type - User currently uses REST API (from Polygon Python API library which is used for the Polygon MCP Server endpoints), and MAY use Web Socket in the future, undecided\
- Provide analysis for REST API vs Web Socket Methods for each
- Usage limits, 
- delayed quote\live data limits, 
- Options Chain Data with Greeks, 
- Stocks Quotes\Snapshots 
- Anything else relevant to our app etc

##
- REMINDER THAT ALL THIS ANALYSIS IS TO BE PART OF A SINGLE DOCUMENT AND NOT SEPARATE DOCS

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- Main Claude Agent to Use Context7 and Sequential-Thinking to Start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit 





## Previous Docs have been commited; Here is new task details:

## DO NOT READ "scratchpad.md" to avoid confusion for new task(s) because that is a temporary User notepad ONLY AND NOT to be read\opened by ANY AI Coding Agent

## Background & Context: User plans on fully implementing the full Polygon API Endpoints, from the Polygon.io Python API Library, to add full endpoints support to the current used Polygon MCP Server in our project. But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker

## New User Task Details: Review, Analyze, and then merge\consolidate the 2x independent separate IBKR comparison docs into a single new consolidated .md doc , and then remove the 2x old docs

- Review, Analyze, and then merge\consolidate the 2x independent separate IBKR comparisons into a new unified single source of truth doc "IBKR_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_FINAL.md"
- The single new doc should assimulate analysis from both docs to remove any dupe, redundant, incorrect etc info
- Having these 2x docs generated by different teams\methods is a "sanity check safe guard" to ensure that there are no conflicting\inaccurate\hallucinated info from 1x party, since we have 2x parties to compare:

1. "IBKR_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_Main_Claude_Agent.md" was generated using Main Claude Agent with Context7 & Sequential-Thinking
2. "IBKR_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_AI_team.md" was generated using AI Team Specialist with NO Context7 & Sequential-Thinking


## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- Start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code\doc review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE\DOC REVIEW, and then perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit 


## Main Claude Agent Instructions:
1. First, I'll use the tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze and get routing
   → Tech lead to follow procedures in both "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/CLAUDE.md" AND "/mnt/d/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/awesome-claude-agents/agents/orchestrators/tech-lead-orchestrator.md" and then returns Agent Routing Map with SPECIFIC agents
   
2. I MUST use ONLY the agents listed in the routing map:
- If tech-lead says "use django-api-developer" → Use that EXACT agent
- If tech-lead says "use react-component-architect" → Use that EXACT agent
- DO NOT substitute with generic agents unless specified as fallback
   
3. Execute tasks in the order specified by tech-lead using TodoWrite

But User is interested in alternative Broker APIs to compare the capabilities to either stick with Polygon, and\or migrate to a brand new Broker

## New User Task Details: AI Team to Generate a new independent "AI Team" generated .md doc for research, investigation, and scope out the IBKR (Interactive Brokers) Broker API Capabilities to compare to the currently used Polygon.io Broker API\Python Library: 

- New single doc named will be "IBKR_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_AI_team.md" in /docs folder
- This Phase 2 independent document will be generated by using AI Agent Team
- Independent generation means do NOT read\reference the existing "IBKR_POLYGON_API_COMPARISON_Main_Claude_Agent.md" doc so we can have 100% independence


- IBKR offers 2x API offerings: Web API & TWS API
- The research needs to have a dedicated analysis EACH for Web API & TWS API, that will EACH have analysis for ALL of the following:

- delayed quote\live data limits, 
- Options Chain Data with Greeks,

- And then a comparison section for Web API vs TWS API
- And then finally, a recommendation to pick between Web API vs TWS API section
- REMINDER THAT ALL THIS ANALYSIS IS TO BE PART OF A SINGLE DOCUMENT AND NOT SEPARATE DOCS

Key Orchestration Rules
Tech-Lead is Routing Authority: Tech-lead determines which agents can handle each task
Strict Agent Selection: Use ONLY agents from tech-lead's "Available Agents" list
No Improvisation: Do NOT select agents based on your own judgment
Deep Reasoning: Apply careful thought when coordinating the recommended agents
Structured Handoffs: Extract and pass information between agent invocations


Agent Selection Flow
CORRECT FLOW:
User Request → Tech-Lead Analysis → Agent Routing Map → Execute with Listed Agents

INCORRECT FLOW:
User Request → Main Agent Guesses → Wrong Agent Selected → Task Fails



Example Tech-Lead Response You Must Follow
When tech-lead returns:

## Available Agents for This Project
- django-backend-expert: Django tasks (EXAMPLE)
- django-api-developer: API tasks   (EXAMPLE)
- react-component-architect: React UI (EXAMPLE)

You MUST use these specific agents, NOT generic alternatives like "backend-developer"








@agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to use SEQUENTIAL THINKING TOOL & CONTEXT7 to analyze the user request to generate a comprehensive plan for delegation & coordination for the requested task(s):

## High Level Task Goal: [BUG] UI Fixes\Enhancments: Button Prompts, Token Cost, and Copy\Export to Markdown

## Task Context & Background:
- MANDATORY MCP TOOL USE FOR SEQUENTIAL THINKING & CONTEXT7 to research the correct proper fixes and fix plan

## Task Details \ Issue Symptoms:
- Button Prompt Actions must be updated to enforce providing a response WITHOUT any user confirmation
- For example, multiple chat request for Button Prompts had the AI incorrectly ask the User to confirm if they wanted Technical Analysis, and\or Support Resistance levels
- Since the Button Prompts are pre-built scripts\templates that are deterministic and NO ambiguity, it does NOT MAKES SENSE for AI to need confirmation - The prompt literally states in black and white what the user wants. AI MAY ask follow on questions for futures requests AFTER the Button prompt response
- Standard AI User Input Chats MAY require confirmation\clarification if needed \ if User request is not clear etc
- Always enforce adding on follow up questions\requests at the end of each response for any related topics user may be interested in based on the answered request

- Not enough Emojis in AI Chat Response; add more emojis, preferably all bullet points should be an emoji etc
- Add color coordinating to put certain key words\statements in Green\Red depending if Bullish\Bearish sentiments
- Token Cost is broken and not working after updating to gpt-5-mini model

- Export Chat to Markdown feature is implemented correctly.  Here is the expect behavior:
1. Remove completely the markdown export text box because user never wanted it - Skip the middle man instead of this un-needed intermediate step
2. SPECIFIC Button for COPY TO CLIPBOARD in markdown format directly
3. SPECIFIC Button for Export TO markdown formatted file, which will then ask the user in a diaglog box where to save the exported .md file
4. SPECIFIC Button for COPY TO CLIPBOARD in JSON format directly
5. SPECIFIC Button for Export TO JSON formatted file, which will then ask the user in a diaglog box where to save the exported .json file

- Stock Ticker, and ALL button prompts should be moved to be directly below the user input chat instead of the current locations
- Increase the vertical size of the user input AI Chatbox to be multiple lines instead of a single line which can be hard to view\read for longer User input requests


## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER CHANGES ARE COMPLETE:
- SPECIALIST to perform Review\Fix Loop until PASSING code review
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, SPECIALIST to perform automous doc updates, git status, then an automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT push to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes, and then a final git status to verify successful commit 
- User will then start testing out the new changes
