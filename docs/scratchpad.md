Task 4. After all tests completed running, Use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from comprehensive_cli_mcp_test_execution_report_2025-01-10.md
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run
5. Detect the current real world date and Pacific timestamp
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format: "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 5. Commit & Push to repo the single test report result doc

Task 5. Use @agent-documentation-specialist to update project docs and testing docs procedures

  & file naming convention as "playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Final Task(s) - Use @agent-documentation-specialist to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final Tasks

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

THESE ARE THE ONLY MCP SERVERS YOU HAVE.  You even detected them. Even teh MPC server guide these are the only 4x MCP servers you have!.  So 2x tools PER mcp server

- Internal thought processes: sequential-thinking
- Research and documentation retrieval: context7
- File system operations: filesystem
- Browser automation and interaction with web interfaces: playwright

Read the follow project docs ONE AT A TIME and acknowledge project state, last completed task(s), operating rules, & MCP Tool PRIMARY use FIRST, before I assign some new task(s):

- CLAUDE.md
- LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md
- MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md

- ALL new CLI Button Tests results match with parity to MCP method results: docs/test_reports/playwright_mcp_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
- Both Playwright Testing for CLI AND MCP Methods wil now have complete 100% Parity for Basic Tests & Button tests, where if we run both methods, test reports should have the same results and testing methodology and no deviations
- All code fixes, doc updates, test reports, and 6/6 test ALL PASS and everything is committed and pushed atomically

## Additional Context

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*
