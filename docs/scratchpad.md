[GPT-5] Update Standalone OpenAI Migration Guide with Github Tool Usage

## Task Description

Update /gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md with more details:

<Task 1> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Analyze, Investigate, & Update

<Task 2> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Analyze, Investigate, & Update

<Closing_Tasks> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform 4x Final Steps for: Review\Fix Loop, Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update, Atomic Github Commit & Github Push, & Final Verification

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

### Step 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed

[GPT-5] Fix incorrectly setup Github MCP Server

## Task Description

<Task 1> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Analyze, Investigate, & fix incorrectly setup GitHub MCP server

- There may have been an incorrect understanding when recently setting up the GitHub MCP server
- Investigate the current code to fix all incorrect code, tests and documentation to remove ALL references and usage of the CLI\UI for Github MCP Server
- Like most MCP servers in our project, MCP servers are mainly focused on the DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT to enhance the workflow
- The ONLY MCP server that the end user CLI & UI code should use is the Polygon MCP server, which is already being used in our app by the AI Agent running the CLI and\or UI
- Github, Sequential-Thinking, Context7, Filesystem are all MCP servers in our project that is ONLY for DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT and NOT for the end user
- It makes zero logical sense to have these development MCP servers being used during the app runtime itself because they have nothing to do with a Finance App

<Task 2> Specialist(s) to Test use Github & Sequential-Thinking MCP Tools to confirm all the Github MCP tools are setup correctly, supported, and usable

- Since this is first time usage of Githhub MCp tools, there may be soem authentication steps needed

<Task 3> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Analyze & update MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md with optimal Github MCP Tool Usage Guide

- The Primary tool for Repo management should be Github, since our projects are stored on github repos
- The Secondary and\or Fail Safe toll for Repo management should be the existin git commands currently used frequently

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary

claude "I am planning on adding a REACT based frontend end for the Chatbot UI, but still keeping the current backend using Python. Use @agent-team-configurator and optimize my project to best use the available subagents and to also add REACT front end, so we will also need the React Specialists even though the current code does not use React YET, but it will on future task"

There are old outdated requirements such as "35% cost reduction, 40% speed improvement, full-stack resource monitoring".  It is TOO early to be worrying about performance improvements at the moment since we are still Prototyping & testing. Use @agent-team-configurator and optimize my project to best use the available subagents with the removal of the "35% cost reduction, 40% speed improvement, full-stack resource monitoring" goals, so we may have to remove specialist(s) and update AI team to remove that goal that is no longer relevant.

Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to review, analyze, and implement the following:
