Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research the most update to date robust practices to review our latest LINT\PyLint\EsLint config\settings, update\optmize them if needed, then re-run full Lint again with the updated practices and fix any new issues

Task 2. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research the most update to date robust practices to fix the remaining non-blocking warnings.  If fixing a specific warning would be too risky, then skip fixing that one.  We need fixes for warnings as long as it is not that intrusive\complex to the code.  If the fix for the warning(s) is significant and high risk of breaking something, it is better to leave the warning and NOT fix it then, so you need to perform risk assessments to fix the prioritized "low hanging fruit , low risk, low complexity" warnings

Task 3. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research the most update to date robust practices to fix the remaining MEDIMUM risk non-blocking LINT warnings

Task 4. Test all the low and medium risk lint fixes using PLaywright MCP, and then fix any issues if needed.

Task 5. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research the most update to date robust practices to fix ALL the remaining ~110 LINT warnings.  Then test all the lint fixes using Playwright MCP, and then fix any issues if needed.

## Final Task(s)

MUST USE Context7 & Sequential-Thinking Tools to perform: Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to research the most update to date robust practices to review and fix any issues from latest Web Console Log: logs/web_console_log.log.  This latest log is with all the latest fixes BUT this time, all I did was open the page only and saved the log.  So those errors are app default startup errors, user actually hasn't performed an action yet, so seems like app startup has some issues.

‚óè Perfect! I can see the issue. Looking at the console log and the code, I can identify several problems:

  1. useRenderLogger (line 239-270) is calling useEffect without any dependency array (line 269), which means it runs on every render, causing infinite render loops.
  2. Excessive logging in ChatInterface_OpenAI - Multiple logging hooks are being called, and they may be triggering unnecessary re-renders.
  3. useStateLogger is being called for multiple state variables that change frequently.

  Let me implement a component that we can manually track first with Why Did You Render, then fix the logging issues:

- One Issue that needs to be fixed is that we need to trim and reduce the prompt and requested data in the Technical Analysis Button Prompt because it failed due to being rate limited that the requested data exceeded OpenAI GPT-5 tokens. So reduce the requested TA indicators.  This failure appears at the end of the log, but you need to review for any other issues too after the latest fixes

[GUI] Fix more GUI Bugs

- Shift up issues looks resolved.

1. Highlighted colored borders STILL exist per the screenshot.  They were supposed to be removed!. I still see blue, green, orange etc

2. The Quick Analysis & Debug Info font size is commically oversized and too big, reduce the font size

- Review the screenshot 'screenshots/image.png' to see all the GUI issues

- Review the Web Console Logs below for more clues on the failures:

We were in the middle of removing some visual styling that was affecting performance but we crashed.

Let's perform a checkpoint commit to save our progress for now.  The fixes have NOT yet been validated by the user, so these fixes are still not fully resolved yet until user tests in a later task.
