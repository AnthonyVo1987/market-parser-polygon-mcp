[OpenAI] Research & Setup vscode-live-server after latest Vite Optimizations

## Task Description

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Research how to setup, config, & integrate vscode-live-server into the current Standalone OpenAI CLI GUI code
- <https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server>

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Based on analysis from Research Tasks, generate a detailed, granular implementation plan to complete the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Implement the plan to setup, config, & integrate vscode-live-server into the current Standalone OpenAI CLI GUI code
- Update ALL project docs and migration docs with updated procedures on how to use and test code with the new vscode-live-server integration

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

- Entire project is still prototyping, so do NOT implement: Enterprise Grade, Production Ready, Performance Optmization, Testing \ Test Scripts
- Do NOT over-engineer

## Expected Outcome

- More details & context for the task(s) can be found in : /gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/OpenAI_Vite_Optimization_Plan.md
- ALL file\doc changes fully reviewed, fixed, committed, and pushed to the repo

## Additional Context




####

Read the follow project docs and acknowledge project state, last completed task(s), & operating rules before I assign some new task(s):

- README.md
- CLAUDE.md,
- MCP_TOOL_USAGE_GUIDE.md
- OpenAI_Vite_Optimization_Plan.md

[GPT-5] Cleanup & Consolidate Dupe OpenAI Standalone Migration Guide

## Task Description

There are 2x nearlly duplicate and redundant OpenAI Standalone Migration docs that needs to be consolidated into a single OpenAI Standalone Migration Guide

<Research Task 1> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, Investigate, & perform the following task(s):

- Read & Review the contents of /docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

<Research Task 2> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, Investigate, & perform the following task(s):

- Read & Review the contents of /gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

<Planning Task 3> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, Investigate, & perform the following task(s):

- Based on analysis from Research Tasks 1 & 2, come up with a plan to consolidate both docs into a single doc

<Task 4> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, Investigate, & perform the following task(s):

- Implement the plan by creating a brand new doc titled "/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/OPENAI_STANDALONE_APP_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md" with the consolidation

<Closing_Tasks> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform 4x Final Steps for: Review\Fix Loop, Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update, Atomic Github Commit & Github Push, & Final Verification

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis

- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status
- ONLY AFTER A PASSING REVIEW, delete both deprecated older migration docs so we now have a single source of truth doc for the migration

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
