### THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED OR READ BY AI AGENTS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY FOR TEMPORARY USER SCRATCHPAD AND NOTES



USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING, CONTEXT7, AND ANY OTHER TOOL CALLS AS NEEDED TO ENSURE MOST UP TO DATE AND ROBUST BEST PRACTICES

## High Level Goal: Implement entire Phase 2: Gradio Integration

## Details
- Implement the entire requested Phase from FEATURE_SCOPE_STOCK_DATA_GUI.md

## ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM ONLY AFTER CHANGES
- Start an automous Code\Doc Review and Fix Loop until we get a passing code review
- If PASSING code review, perform an autonomous ATOMIC git commit and push to the repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes
##




Scope out and update the scope doc to enforce a "single source of truth FSM (Finite State Machine)"
- Current scope already has some state management, but let's make it a full on deterministic FSM
- So research the best practices to implement a FSM according to our app's architecture, app stack, and the scope doc details


- Update the entire implementation plan with the updated details

## High Level Goal: Scope new feat: Add GUI elements to be update\populated with data from certain new AI prompts actions


## Details

1. Add GUI elements that will be later updated and populated with data from responses:
- Stock Snapshot
- Support & Resistance Levels - 3 levels EACH
- Technical Analysis - RSI, MACD, EMA 5\10\20\50\200, SMA 5\10\20\50\200

2. Add some Button Prompts that user can click that will insert in specific Prompts for the AI Agent Chat:
- Current Stock Snapshot
- Support & Resistance Levels - 3 levels EACH
- Technical Analysis - RSI, MACD, EMA 5\10\20\50\200, SMA 5\10\20\50\200

3. After a button prompt is completed with a proper chat response, the app\ai agent etc now needs to update the corresponding GUI elements with the response data

4. ONLY the button prompts are allowed to update the new GUI elements. Any other chat interactions from user will NOT trigger the new gui updates

5. Generate a new.md doc in the docs folder for the new scoping details
