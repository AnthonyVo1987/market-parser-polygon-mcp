# üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

üî¥ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failingplan

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

<Research Topic Details> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE üî¥

---

<Planning Phase> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE üî¥

---

<Implementation Phase>

You MUST Systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to Implement all code changes, test suite updates, and agent instruction modifications according to the TODO_task_plan.md

---

<CLI Testing Phase> üî¥ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - DO NOT SKIP üî¥

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: You MUST run tests BEFORE claiming completion** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Task is INCOMPLETE without test execution and results** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**

1. ‚úÖ **Execute the test suite:**

   ```bash
   ./CLI_test_regression.sh
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Verify test results:**
   - All tests PASS (must show 100% success rate)
   - Test report generated in test-reports/
   - No errors or failures in output
   - Session persistence verified

3. ‚úÖ **Show evidence to user:**
   - Display test summary output
   - Show pass/fail counts (must be X/X PASS)
   - Provide test report file path
   - Show performance metrics (response times)

**‚ùå ENFORCEMENT RULES:**

- Code without test execution = Code NOT implemented
- No test results = Task INCOMPLETE
- Must run tests BEFORE Serena memory update phase
- Cannot claim "done" without showing test evidence
- Test failures must be fixed and re-tested

**‚úÖ ONLY PROCEED to next phase after:**

- Test suite executed successfully
- 100% pass rate achieved
- Test results displayed to user
- Test report path provided

üî¥ **IF YOU SKIP THIS PHASE, THE ENTIRE TASK IS INVALID** üî¥

---

<Serena Update Memories Phase>

Update Serena memory files with new tool information, architecture changes, and test results (ONLY after tests pass)
