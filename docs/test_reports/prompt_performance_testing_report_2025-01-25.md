# Prompt Performance Testing Report

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Test Duration:** 11:35 AM - 11:51 AM ET  
**Test Environment:** CLI Backend (`uv run src/backend/main.py`)  
**Timeout Setting:** 180 seconds per test case  

## Executive Summary

This report documents performance testing experiments conducted to measure the impact of different prompt configurations on AI response times. The testing involved three different prompt configurations across three test prompts, with the goal of identifying the optimal balance between response speed and data quality.

## Test Configuration

### Test Prompts Used

1. **"Current Market Status"** - General market analysis
2. **"Single Stock Snapshot NVDA"** - Stock-specific data retrieval
3. **"NVDA Support & Resistance Levels"** - Technical analysis

### Test Cases

- **Task 1:** Detailed Analysis commented out (Data cleanup active)
- **Task 2:** Detailed Analysis active, Data cleanup commented out
- **Task 3:** Both Detailed Analysis and Data cleanup commented out

## Test Results

### Task 1: Detailed Analysis Commented Out

**Configuration:** Data cleanup active, Detailed Analysis removed

| Test Prompt | Status | Response Time | Model | Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Current Market Status | ❌ Failed | Timeout (180s) | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |
| Single Stock Snapshot NVDA | ❌ Failed | Timeout (180s) | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |
| NVDA Support & Resistance Levels | ❌ Failed | Timeout (180s) | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |

**Analysis:** All tests failed due to OpenAI server errors (500), indicating API instability rather than prompt configuration issues.

### Task 2: Data Cleanup Commented Out

**Configuration:** Detailed Analysis active, Data cleanup removed

| Test Prompt | Status | Response Time | Model | Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Current Market Status | ✅ Success | 67.806s | gpt-5-nano | Full response with analysis |
| Single Stock Snapshot NVDA | ❌ Failed | ~52s | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |
| NVDA Support & Resistance Levels | ❌ Failed | ~52s | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |

**Analysis:** One successful test showing 67.8s response time with full Detailed Analysis but no data cleanup formatting.

### Task 3: Both Commented Out (Minimal Response)

**Configuration:** Both Detailed Analysis and Data cleanup removed

| Test Prompt | Status | Response Time | Model | Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Current Market Status | ❌ Failed | ~31s | N/A | OpenAI 500 error |
| Single Stock Snapshot NVDA | ✅ Success | 152.789s | gpt-5-nano | Minimal response format |
| NVDA Support & Resistance Levels | ❌ Failed | ~31s | N/A | Rate limit (503 error) |

**Analysis:** One successful test showing 152.8s response time with minimal formatting, but interestingly slower than Task 2.

## Key Findings

### 1. Response Time Comparison

- **Task 2 (Analysis + No Cleanup):** 67.8s
- **Task 3 (No Analysis + No Cleanup):** 152.8s

**Unexpected Result:** The minimal response configuration (Task 3) was actually slower than the configuration with Detailed Analysis (Task 2).

### 2. API Stability Issues

- Multiple OpenAI 500 server errors throughout testing
- Rate limiting (503 errors) appeared after multiple requests
- Inconsistent API availability affected test reliability

### 3. Data Quality vs. Speed Trade-off

- Task 2 provided the best balance: faster response (67.8s) with full analysis
- Task 3, despite being "minimal," was significantly slower (152.8s)

## Technical Observations

### Successful Response Examples

**Task 2 - Current Market Status (67.8s):**

```
A. DATA FIRST
• Market: Open (market-wide)
• Server Time (ET): 2025-09-25 14:41:03 -04:00
• After Hours: No
• Early Hours: No
• US Exchanges: NYSE open, NASDAQ open, OTC open
• Major Indices (tickers): S&P 500 (^GSPC) open, Dow Jones (^DJI) open, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) open
• Currencies: Crypto market open, FX market open
• System time reference: 2025-09-25 11:40:45

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS
1 Current market status confirms a full trading session
2 Cross-asset participation is active
3 Time reference considerations
```

**Task 3 - Single Stock Snapshot NVDA (152.8s):**

```
A. DATA FIRST
• NVDA price: 177.08
• Change (today): +0.11
• Change %: +0.06%
• Day Open: 174.48
• Day High: 180.26
• Day Low: 173.13
• Prev Close: 176.97
• Day Volume: 149,093,049
• Day VWAP: 177.22
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimal Configuration

Based on the limited successful tests, **Task 2 configuration** appears optimal:

- Keep Detailed Analysis active
- Remove data cleanup formatting overhead
- Provides faster response times with comprehensive analysis

### 2. API Reliability

- Implement retry logic for OpenAI 500/503 errors
- Add exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Consider request queuing for high-frequency testing

### 3. Further Testing

- Conduct more tests during stable API periods
- Test with different model configurations
- Validate results across multiple time periods

## Limitations

1. **API Instability:** OpenAI server errors significantly impacted test reliability
2. **Limited Sample Size:** Only 2 successful tests out of 9 attempts
3. **Time Constraints:** Rate limiting prevented complete test execution
4. **Single Model:** Tests only used gpt-5-nano model

## Conclusion

The performance testing revealed that removing data cleanup formatting while maintaining Detailed Analysis (Task 2) provides the best balance of speed and quality. However, the testing was significantly impacted by OpenAI API instability, requiring additional testing during more stable periods to draw definitive conclusions.

The unexpected finding that minimal responses were slower than detailed responses suggests that the AI model may perform better with more structured, comprehensive prompts rather than overly simplified ones.
