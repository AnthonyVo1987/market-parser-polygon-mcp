## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety First

### Critical Security Requirements

Based on code review findings, these security measures are **MANDATORY**:

1. **Environment Isolation**: Run only in development environments
2. **API Key Protection**: Secure `.env` file with 600 permissions
3. **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated and sanitized
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during execution
5. **Evidence Collection**: Complete audit trail for all activities

### Security Quick Check
```bash
# Verify secure environment
ls -la .env                    # Should show 600 permissions
grep -q "production" .env && echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Production environment detected"
```

---

## üìä Quality Assurance Requirements

### Testing Integrity Protocols

To prevent false reporting and ensure accurate results:

1. **Complete Execution**: All requested tests must be attempted
2. **Evidence-Based Validation**: Every result requires supporting evidence
3. **Multi-Layer Verification**: Pre-, during-, and post-execution validation
4. **Performance Classification**: Accurate timing and classification (üòäüòêüò¥‚ùå)
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from command to final report

### QA Validation Checklist
- [ ] All servers running and healthy
- [ ] Environment properly configured with secure API keys
- [ ] Official test specifications followed (B001-B016)
- [ ] Evidence collected for all test executions
- [ ] Performance accurately classified and documented
- [ ] Security review passed without violations

## üéØ Command Selection Guide

### CLI Method (`/test_cli_full`)
**Best For:**
- Development and debugging
- Quick validation during development
- Resource-constrained environments
- Performance benchmarking

**Characteristics:**
- Faster execution (~30-60 minutes)
- Lower resource usage
- Direct command-line testing
- More üòäüòê classifications expected

### MCP Method (`/test_mcp_full`)
**Best For:**
- UI/UX validation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- End-to-end user journey testing
- Production-readiness validation

**Characteristics:**
- Comprehensive testing (~45-90 minutes)
- Browser automation with single session protocol
- More thorough but slower
- More üòêüò¥ classifications expected

---

## üìã Testing Methodology Standards

### Single Browser Session Protocol (MCP)
```
Browser Open (ONCE) ‚Üí B001-B016 Tests ‚Üí Browser Close (ONCE)
```
**Critical**: All MCP tests must execute in the same browser instance to simulate real-world usage patterns and maintain session state continuity.

### Performance Classification System
- **Good üòä**: ‚â§30 seconds (optimal performance)
- **OK üòê**: 31-60 seconds (acceptable performance)
- **Slow üò¥**: 61-119 seconds (functional but slow)
- **Timeout ‚ùå**: ‚â•120 seconds (needs investigation)

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Complete B001-B016 Suite**: All 16 tests must be attempted
- **Evidence Collection**: Documentation for every test execution
- **Quality Validation**: Multi-layer verification of results
- **Performance Tracking**: Accurate timing and classification

## üîß Common Issues & Quick Solutions

### Server Not Responding
```bash
# Quick diagnostic
curl http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Backend down"
curl http://localhost:3000/ || echo "Frontend down"

# Quick restart
pkill -f uvicorn && pkill -f "npm run dev"
# Then restart both servers
```

### Environment Issues
```bash
# Check environment file
ls -la .env || echo "Missing .env file"
grep -E "POLYGON_API_KEY|OPENAI_API_KEY" .env || echo "Missing API keys"
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check system resources
free -h                    # Memory usage
top -bn1 | head -5         # CPU usage
df -h                      # Disk space
```
