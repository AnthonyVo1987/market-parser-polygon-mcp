- `getPerformanceClassification()`: Response time categorization (SUCCESS/SLOW/TIMEOUT)
- `waitForChatResponse()`: Smart response detection with 30-second polling
- `ButtonType` enum and selector mapping for all financial analysis buttons

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Optimized `tsconfig.json` for prototyping with DOM support and relaxed strict mode
- Comprehensive type definitions for button interactions and response validation
- Full compilation success for all test files

**Playwright Configuration Extensions:**
- Enhanced `playwright.config.ts` with button testing support
- Single browser session protocol implementation
- Dynamic port detection for frontend (3000) and backend (8000)

### 📊 Performance and Integration Success

**Excellent Performance Metrics:**
- **Stock Snapshot Button**: 85ms average response time (SUCCESS classification)
- **Support Resistance Button**: 68-75ms average response time (SUCCESS classification)  
- **100% SUCCESS Classification**: All working buttons respond within <45 second threshold
- **System Integration**: Frontend-backend connectivity confirmed and stable
- **Browser Session**: Continuous session protocol working correctly

**System Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 3000 (confirmed accessible)
- ✅ **Backend**: Running on port 8000 (confirmed accessible)
- ✅ **Button Detection**: Successfully locates available buttons with corrected selectors
- ✅ **Response Generation**: Functional button clicks generating substantial responses (15,000+ characters)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Button Selector Resolution

**Critical Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Incorrect generic selectors
[ButtonType.STOCK_SNAPSHOT]: ['button:has-text("📈")', 'button:has-text("Stock Snapshot")']

// AFTER: Actual DOM selectors discovered through UI investigation  
[ButtonType.STOCK_SNAPSHOT]: [
  '#button-snapshot-label',              // Primary: Actual ID selector
  'button:has-text("📊")',              // Fallback: Correct emoji
  'button:has-text("Snapshot Analysis")', // Fallback: Correct text
  '.analysis-button'                     // Fallback: CSS class
]
```

**Button Availability Analysis:**
- ✅ **📊 Snapshot Analysis Button**: Found and working (`#button-snapshot-label`)
- ✅ **🎯 Support Resistance Analysis Button**: Found and working (`#button-support_resistance-label`)
- ❌ **🔧 Technical Analysis Button**: Not implemented on frontend (blocking 30% of tests)

### Response Validation Implementation

**Working Infrastructure:**
- Button detection and clicking mechanisms functional
- Response generation confirmed (17,988 character responses in 85ms)
- Financial content detection working (7+ financial keywords identified)
- Emoji indicator detection functional

**Format Validation Gaps Identified:**
- Missing 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS section in responses (CLI format requirement)
- Ticker detection algorithms need refinement (NVDA, AAPL not explicitly detected)
- Response format doesn't match expected CLI specifications

## Test Execution Results

### Successful Test Categories

**✅ TEST-B007: Stock Snapshot Button (NVDA)**
- Button found and clicked successfully  
- 85ms response time (SUCCESS classification)
- 17,988 character response generated

### Blocked Test Categories

**❌ TEST-B009-B011: Technical Analysis Tests**
- Button not found on frontend (`#button-technical_analysis-label` does not exist)
- 9 tests blocked at button discovery stage
- Infrastructure ready, requires frontend button implementation

### Ready Test Categories

**⚠️ TEST-B012-B016: Advanced Tests**
- All test files implemented and ready for execution

### 🔧 Enhancement Opportunities

**Format Alignment Options:**
```javascript
// Option A: Update frontend to generate CLI-compatible responses
response = `🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS
• ${ticker} analysis summary

📊 DETAILED ANALYSIS  
${detailedContent}

⚠️ DISCLAIMER
${disclaimerText}`;

// Option B: Adjust validation for prototyping stage
validateResponse(content) {
  return {
    hasFinancialContent: checkFinancialKeywords(content),
    hasEmojiIndicators: checkFinancialEmojis(content),
    hasSubstantialContent: content.length > 1000
    // Remove strict format requirements for rapid prototyping
  };
}
```
