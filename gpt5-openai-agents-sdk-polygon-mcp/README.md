## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you don't have it:**
    ```bash
    curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. **Get your API keys:**
   - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - [Polygon.io API key](https://polygon.io/)

3. **Environment Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Copy the example environment file
    cp .env.example .env
    
    # Edit .env with your API keys
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
    POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
    ```

### Installation & Usage

#### Option 1: CLI Interface
```bash
# Run the enhanced CLI with emoji sentiment indicators
uv run src/main.py

# Type your financial questions and press Enter!
# Type 'exit' to quit.
```

#### Option 2: FastAPI Server + Optimized React Frontend
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start FastAPI server
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Start Vite-optimized React frontend
cd frontend_OpenAI
npm install
npm run dev  # Development with local API (optimized startup ~337ms)

# Alternative environment builds:
# npm run dev:staging     # Staging environment development
# npm run build          # Production build with PWA and optimizations
# npm run build:staging  # Staging environment build
# npm run analyze        # Bundle analysis with performance insights
# npm run lighthouse     # Lighthouse CI performance validation

# Open http://localhost:3000 for the web interface
```

**Vite Optimization Highlights:**
- **45% Bundle Size Reduction**: Main bundle optimized from 68KB to 37.19KB
- **Progressive Web App**: Auto-generated PWA with offline capabilities
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Development, staging, and production configurations
- **Zero Code Quality Issues**: All ESLint and TypeScript validations passing
- **Advanced Performance Features**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and Lighthouse CI monitoring

#### Option 3: Legacy CLI (Original)
```bash
# Legacy CLI interface (still supported)
uv run main.py
```

## Example Usage

### CLI Interface
```bash
> last trade for AAPL
✔ Query processed successfully!
📈 Agent Response:
$AAPL last trade: $XXX.XX at 2025-08-13 15:30:00 UTC

🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS
📈 Stock price at recent high
💰 Trading volume above average
📊 Market sentiment: Bullish
---------------------

> exit
Goodbye!
```

### Web Interface Features
- **Button Prompts**: Quick-access buttons for snapshot, technical, and support/resistance analysis
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive conversation with loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting for analysis results

### Analysis Agent Workflow
The financial analysis agent follows these steps:
1. **Guardrail Verification**: Ensure finance-related queries
2. **Data Gathering**: Collect market data via Polygon.io tools
3. **AI Analysis**: Process data using GPT-5 with financial expertise
4. **Emoji Indicators**: Add sentiment indicators (📈 bullish, 📉 bearish)
5. **Report Generation**: Offer to save detailed markdown reports

### Advanced Example
```bash
> Do a return on investment analysis of Meta vs Microsoft. Review news, sentiment, rating, earnings. Analyze the results. Save a report.
```

This will generate a comprehensive report saved to `reports/equities/meta_vs_microsoft_analysis.md` with:
- Detailed financial comparison
- News sentiment analysis
- Earnings analysis
- Investment recommendations
- Risk assessment

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Issues
- **Missing API Key:**  
  If you see an error about `POLYGON_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ensure your `.env` file contains both keys:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
  POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key_here
  ```

- **`uvx: command not found`:**  
  Install `uv` with `curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or `pip install uv`.

### Installation Issues
- **Dependencies:**  
  `uv run` will install from `pyproject.toml`. For manual installation:
  ```bash
  uv install  # Installs all dependencies
  # Or with pip:
  pip install openai-agents pydantic rich python-dotenv openai fastapi uvicorn
  ```

### Frontend Issues
- **React frontend won't start:**
  ```bash
  cd frontend_OpenAI
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  npm run dev  # Optimized Vite development server
  ```

- **CORS errors:**  
  Ensure FastAPI server is running on port 8000 and React on port 3000. The Vite proxy configuration automatically handles API routing.

- **Environment-specific issues:**
  ```bash
  # Check environment configuration
  npm run dev:staging      # Test staging environment
  npm run build:development # Test development build
  npm run type-check       # Validate TypeScript (should show zero errors)
  npm run lint            # Validate ESLint (should show zero errors)
  ```

- **Performance validation:**
  ```bash
  npm run analyze         # Generate bundle analysis report
  npm run lighthouse      # Run performance testing
  # Reports available at dist/bundle-analysis.html
  ```

### Runtime Issues
- **Guardrail blocks non‑finance prompts:**  
  Try a market or finance-related query.

- **Port conflicts:**
  - FastAPI: Use `--port 8001` if 8000 is occupied
  - React: Use `PORT=3001 npm run dev` if 3000 is occupied

- **Error reporting:**  
  All errors are displayed with detailed messages for debugging.

```

### How It Works
1. **Environment Setup**: Loads API keys from `.env` file
2. **MCP Server**: Automatically starts Polygon.io MCP server via `uvx`
3. **Agent Framework**: Runs GPT-5 analysis agent with financial guardrails
4. **Multi-Interface**: 
   - CLI: Direct terminal interaction with rich formatting
   - API: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
   - Web: React frontend with button prompts and chat interface
5. **Report Generation**: Saves formatted analyses to `reports/<category>/...`
6. **State Management**: Maintains conversation context across interfaces
