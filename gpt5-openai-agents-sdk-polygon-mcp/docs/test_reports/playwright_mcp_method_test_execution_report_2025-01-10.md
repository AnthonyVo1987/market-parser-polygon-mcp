## Error Analysis and Backend Investigation

### Critical Backend Issues Identified

1. **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error Pattern**
   - **Manifestation**: Systematic server failures on TEST-B004 and TEST-B005
   - **Error Scope**: Backend API processing failures, not frontend issues
   - **Impact**: 50% test failure rate due to server-side processing problems

2. **Potential Backend Resource Issues**
   - **Hypothesis**: Backend may be experiencing resource exhaustion after 3 successful operations
   - **Evidence**: First 3 tests successful, subsequent tests failing with server errors
   - **Indicators**: OpenAI rate limiting observed during TEST-B002, possible API quota/connection issues

3. **Frontend Error Handling Excellence**
   - **Positive Finding**: Frontend demonstrated exceptional error resilience
   - **User Experience**: Clear error messages, stable UI, no crashes or corruption
   - **Recovery Capability**: System remained operational for continued testing attempts

### Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Backend Server Log Analysis** (CRITICAL)
   - Examine FastAPI server logs for detailed error messages
   - Check OpenAI API connection status and rate limiting
   - Verify MCP server connectivity and resource utilization

2. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Monitor backend memory usage and API connection pools
   - Check for database connection issues or timeout problems
   - Verify environment variables and API key validity

3. **Backend Service Restart**
   - Consider restarting FastAPI backend service to clear potential state issues
   - Verify MCP server connectivity after restart
   - Re-test failed queries after backend stabilization
