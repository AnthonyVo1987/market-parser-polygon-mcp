## Performance Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tests Executed** | 6 |
| **Tests Passed** | 0 |
| **Tests Failed** | 6 |
| **Success Rate** | 0% |
| **Average Response Time** | N/A (all timeouts) |

| **HTTP 500 Errors** | 5 confirmed |
| **Timeouts** | 6 (all tests) |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Identified Issues

1. **Backend Service Failure**
   - All requests resulted in HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
   - Backend health check passed but actual request processing failed
   - Likely issue with MCP server integration or OpenAI API connection

2. **Timeout Configuration**
   - Frontend configured with 120-second timeout
   - Backend processing exceeds timeout threshold
   - No successful responses received within timeout window

3. **Error Pattern**
   - Consistent failure across all test types
   - Both simple (single ticker) and complex (multi-ticker) requests failed
   - Market status request (simplest query) also failed

### Console Errors Captured
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) @ http://localhost:8000/chat:0
```

## Compliance Verification

### ✅ Test Specification Compliance
- Used exact query patterns from official specifications
- Maintained single browser session throughout all tests
- Applied 30-second polling methodology correctly
- Executed all required Basic Tests

### ✅ Browser Session Protocol
- Single browser instance maintained for all 6 tests
- No browser restarts between tests
- Proper state preservation throughout testing

### ✅ Server Verification
- Both servers confirmed running before test execution
- Health checks passed initially
- CORS configuration appeared functional

## Critical Findings

1. **System Non-Functional**: The Market Parser application is currently non-functional due to backend failures
2. **Complete Test Failure**: 0% success rate indicates critical system issue
3. **Backend Investigation Required**: HTTP 500 errors suggest server-side processing failure
4. **Possible Causes**:
   - MCP server connection issues
   - OpenAI API key problems
   - Polygon.io data access failures
   - Backend exception handling errors

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Check backend server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify MCP server (uvx) is properly configured and accessible
3. Validate OpenAI API key and quota status
4. Test Polygon.io API connectivity independently
5. Review recent code changes that may have introduced the issue

### Testing Protocol
- Testing methodology was correct and compliant
- Single browser session protocol successfully maintained
- 30-second polling effectively detected timeout conditions
- No issues with test execution process itself

## Test Execution Evidence

### Browser Session Timeline
```
17:24:01 - Browser opened, navigated to http://localhost:3000
17:24:01 - Market Status test initiated
17:26:04 - Market Status test failed (500 error)
17:26:51 - NVDA test initiated (same browser)
17:28:53 - NVDA test failed (500 error)
17:29:17 - SPY test initiated (same browser)
17:31:18 - SPY test failed (500 error)
17:31:41 - GME test initiated (same browser)
17:33:43 - GME test failed (500 error)
17:34:37 - Multi-Ticker test initiated (same browser)
17:36:37 - Browser closed (Multi-Ticker still processing)
```

## Conclusion

The Basic Tests execution revealed a **critical system failure** preventing any financial data processing. While the test execution methodology was correct and compliant with specifications, the backend service is experiencing complete failure with all requests resulting in HTTP 500 errors. The system requires immediate backend investigation and repair before any functional testing can proceed.

**Test Status**: ❌ FAILED - System Non-Functional  
**Next Steps**: Backend debugging and service restoration required
