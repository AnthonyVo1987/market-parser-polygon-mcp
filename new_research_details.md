# üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

üî¥ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failingplan

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

<Phase 1: Research> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS Research PHASE üî¥
ULTRA-THINK to Research the requested task(s):

1. Research updating some AI Agent tools to use Tradier API Endpoints
- https://docs.tradier.com/reference/brokerage-api-markets-get-quotes
- https://docs.tradier.com/reference/brokerage-api-markets-get-clock
- Update AI Agent instructions for the updated tools
- Test the new tools by calling the CLI and testing with requested for each of the following tickers one at a time, and then a multi test: SPY, NVDA, SOUN, QQQ, IWM
- Fix any issues if needed from testing to make the tool tests work properly


1. 'get_stock_quote' to use Tradier Endpoint:
- 'get_stock_quote' can now be used for both SINGLE AND MULTI Tickers within a single tool call
- So we only need the new 'get_stock_quote' to handle any number of tickers in a single tool call

Here is a the example API endpoint Python Call & Response :

```
import requests

url = "https://api.tradier.com/v1/markets/quotes?symbols=SPY"

headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer <TRADIER_API_KEY>"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```

      }
    ]
  }
}
```



2. 'get_market_status_and_date_time' to use Tradier Endpoint:

Here is a the example API endpoint Python Call & Response :

```
import requests

url = "https://api.tradier.com/v1/markets/clock"

headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer <TRADIER_API_KEY>"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

```
{
  "clock": {
    "date": "2021-02-01",
    "description": "open",
    "state": "open",
    "timestamp": 1612196262,
    "next_state": "post",
    "next_change": 1612213200
  }
}
```




2. If quick test of the new tool works, add new test case in 'test_cli_regression.sh' after "Technical Analysis: " for SPY and NVDA to retreive the OPtions Expiraton Dates.  Then run the full test and review the responses to ensure the new tool works as expected.

---

<Phase 2: Planning> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS Planning PHASE üî¥

Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), delete the current file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and then create a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md' for you to systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit for Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to Implement the requested task(s) with Comprehensive Documentation Updates to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info, and You MUST create a CLI Testing Phase as part of the Plan to run testing to validate any code changes.  The plan MUST enforce that YOU MUST Systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to enhance your workflow to perform all task(s)

---

<Phase 3: Implementation> üî¥ CRITICAL: NOW YOU MAY START IMPLEMENTING DURING THIS PHASE üî¥

You MUST Systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to Implement all code changes, test suite updates, and agent instruction modifications according to the TODO_task_plan.md

---

<Phase 4: Testing>

  üî¥ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - DO NOT SKIP üî¥

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: You MUST run tests BEFORE claiming completion** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Task is INCOMPLETE without test execution and results** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**

1. ‚úÖ **Execute the test suite:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Verify test results:**
   - All tests PASS (must show 100% success rate)
   - Test report generated in test-reports/
   - No errors or failures in output
   - Session persistence verified

3. ‚úÖ **Show evidence to user:**
   - Display test summary output
   - Show pass/fail counts (must be X/X PASS)
   - Provide test report file path
   - Show performance metrics (response times)

**‚ùå ENFORCEMENT RULES:**

- Code without test execution = Code NOT implemented
- No test results = Task INCOMPLETE
- Must run tests BEFORE Serena memory update phase
- Cannot claim "done" without showing test evidence
- Test failures must be fixed and re-tested

**‚úÖ ONLY PROCEED to next phase after:**

- Test suite executed successfully
- 100% pass rate achieved
- Test results displayed to user
- Test report path provided

üî¥ **IF YOU SKIP THIS PHASE, THE ENTIRE TASK IS INVALID** üî¥

---

<Phase 5: Serena Project Memories Update Phase>

Use Serena Tools to update Serena project memory files

---

<Phase 6: Final Git Commit Phase> üî¥ CRITICAL: PROPER ATOMIC COMMIT WORKFLOW üî¥

**MANDATORY: Stage ONLY Immediately Before Commit**

**CORRECT Workflow (follow EXACTLY):**

1. **DO ALL WORK FIRST** (DO NOT stage anything yet):
   - ‚úÖ Complete ALL code changes
   - ‚úÖ Run ALL tests and generate test reports
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL documentation (CLAUDE.md, tech_stack.md, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL config files (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL Serena memories
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL task plans
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN `git add` YET**

2. **VERIFY EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Review ALL changed/new files
   git diff    # Review ALL changes
   ```

   - Ensure ALL work is done
   - Ensure ALL files are present

3. **STAGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE**:

   ```bash
   git add -A  # Stage ALL files in ONE command
   ```

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the FIRST time you run `git add`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Stage ALL related files together

4. **VERIFY STAGING IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Verify ALL files staged, NOTHING unstaged
   ```

   - If anything is missing: `git add [missing-file]`

5. **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY** (within 60 seconds of staging):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [TAG] Descriptive commit message

   - Change 1
   - Change 2

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

**WHAT BELONGS IN ATOMIC COMMIT:**

- ‚úÖ Code changes (backend + frontend)
- ‚úÖ Test reports (evidence of passing tests)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Memory updates (.serena/memories/)
- ‚úÖ Config changes (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Task plan updates (TODO_task_plan.md, etc.)

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:**

- ‚ùå Stage files early during development
- ‚ùå Stage files "as you go"
- ‚ùå Run `git add` before ALL work is complete
- ‚ùå Delay between `git add` and `git commit`
- ‚ùå Commit without test reports
- ‚ùå Commit without documentation updates

**Reference:** See `.serena/memories/git_commit_workflow.md` for complete details
