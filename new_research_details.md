# üî¥ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

üî¥ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. üî¥ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failingplan

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

üî¥ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

üî¥ CRITICAL: FOLLOW THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW PHASES IN ORDER FOR THE REQUESTED NEW CHANGES. RESEARCH -> PLANNING -> IMPLEMENTATION -> TESTING -> SERENA -> COMMIT üî¥

---

<Phase 1: Research> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS Research PHASE üî¥
ULTRA-THINK to Research the requested task(s):

## Task 1. Research updating\migrating all the response formatting logic from AI agent instructions to more deterministic response formatting by completely offloading to the python AI Agent tools and logic.

- Every tool itself is completely responsible for the output markdown formatting, that way the AI agent spends less time post-processing and less token usage trying to format or filter or clean up the data\response for the user, now we‚Äôll just handle that in the tools itself since the tools directly have the raw payload from the API endpoint calls. 
- It‚Äôs just quicker to have the tools directly or either have helper functions in each tool to post process filter, re-organize and clean up the formatting into markdown. and then the tool response back to the AI agent will have the cleaned up response formatting already performed.
- Now all the AA agent has to do can just Easily just directly use the response from the tool after doing a quick sanity check that the response for request it was actually correct
- It can clean up any potential formatting issues that may have got missed during the initial Pythong Tool post-processing instead of having to create the entire response format itself
- So in each of the tools, it needs to do the cleanup to convert any of those API end points responses into more user readable, pretty printed numbered bullet points and or markdown tables and charts if needed, depending on the data complexity
- this should be a lot quicker to have the tools perform all the formatting and processing since now since all the API end points are always deterministic and in the same formatting every time and the Python tools can create the helper formatting functions to also be deterministic every time to have a standardized formatting because the current way if we rely on the AI agent on the formatting, it may not be a deterministic in the formatting and may change every now and then depending on how the AI decides to format the instructions

Update Options Chain Markdown Table Display Formatting & Data
- Strike prices do NOT need decimals if price are whole Integers. Only need to show decimals if there is a non-integer. IE $185, $190, $192.50, $197. etc
- Add $ Units to Strike, Bid, Ask Column Headers
- Remove completely Vega & Theta columns and data for now to just have essential Greeks
- IV: Just use integer percent with no decimals : IE. 50%, 150%, 25% etc
- Use 'Vol' & 'OI' for Volume and Open Intrest abbreviations
- Reorder columns as follows: Strike, Bid, Ask, Delta, Vol, OI, IV, Gamma, Theta

- Perform quick manual testing of all tool outputs and verify output responses and check for proper formatting

---

<Phase 2: Planning> üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS Planning PHASE üî¥

Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), delete the current file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and then ULTRA-THINK AND GENERATE a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md' for you to systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit for Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to Implement the requested task(s) with Comprehensive Documentation Updates to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info, and You MUST create a CLI Testing Phase as part of the Plan to run testing to validate any code changes.  The plan MUST enforce that YOU MUST Systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to enhance your workflow to perform all task(s)

---

<Phase 3: Implementation> üî¥ CRITICAL: NOW YOU MAY START IMPLEMENTING DURING THIS PHASE üî¥

You MUST Systemtically use your Mandatory Tools Toolkit Sequential-Thinking & Serena tools to Implement all code changes, test suite updates, and agent instruction modifications according to the TODO_task_plan.md

---

<Phase 4: Testing>

  üî¥ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - DO NOT SKIP üî¥

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: You MUST run tests BEFORE claiming completion** ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Task is INCOMPLETE without test execution and results** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**

1. ‚úÖ **Execute the test suite:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x test_cli_regression.sh && ./test_cli_regression.sh
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Verify test results:**
   üî¥ MANDATORY - VERIFY THE CONTENT OF EACH TEST PROMPT RESPONSE THAT IT MATCHES THE EXPECTED RESPONSE, PROPER TOOL CALLS, AND RESPONSE FORMATTINGüî¥

<Phase 5: Serena Project Memories Update Phase>

Use Serena Tools to update Serena project memory files

---

<Phase 6: Final Git Commit Phase> üî¥ CRITICAL: PROPER ATOMIC COMMIT WORKFLOW üî¥

**MANDATORY: Stage ONLY Immediately Before Commit**

**CORRECT Workflow (follow EXACTLY):**

1. **DO ALL WORK FIRST** (DO NOT stage anything yet):
   - ‚úÖ Complete ALL code changes
   - ‚úÖ Run ALL tests and generate test reports
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL documentation (CLAUDE.md, tech_stack.md, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL config files (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL Serena memories
   - ‚úÖ Update ALL task plans
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN `git add` YET**

2. **VERIFY EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Review ALL changed/new files
   git diff    # Review ALL changes
   ```

   - Ensure ALL work is done
   - Ensure ALL files are present

3. **STAGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE**:

   ```bash
   git add -A  # Stage ALL files in ONE command
   ```

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the FIRST time you run `git add`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Stage ALL related files together

4. **VERIFY STAGING IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git status  # Verify ALL files staged, NOTHING unstaged
   ```

   - If anything is missing: `git add [missing-file]`

5. **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY** (within 60 seconds of staging):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [TAG] Descriptive commit message

   - Change 1
   - Change 2

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY**:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

**WHAT BELONGS IN ATOMIC COMMIT:**

- ‚úÖ Code changes (backend + frontend)
- ‚úÖ Test reports (evidence of passing tests)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Memory updates (.serena/memories/)
- ‚úÖ Config changes (.claude/settings.local.json, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Task plan updates (TODO_task_plan.md, etc.)

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:**

- ‚ùå Stage files early during development
- ‚ùå Stage files "as you go"
- ‚ùå Run `git add` before ALL work is complete
- ‚ùå Delay between `git add` and `git commit`
- ‚ùå Commit without test reports
- ‚ùå Commit without documentation updates

**Reference:** See `.serena/memories/git_commit_workflow.md` for complete details
