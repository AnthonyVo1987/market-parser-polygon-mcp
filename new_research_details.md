<Research Topic Details> ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE ðŸ”´

- Create a new tool for our AI Agent called 'get_market_status_and_date_time' using the Polygon Python Library Function "client.get_market_status". Use docs-polygon tools to fetch Polygon Python documentation on how to use the library. You wil have to import the library in in order to call the proper endpoints
- .env file has my Polygon API key 'POLYGON_API_KEY' to use with the new Polygon API
- Update AI Agent Instructions to replace current tool 'get_market_status' to use the new custom tool 'get_market_status_and_date_time' to retrieve either current market status, date, and\or time
- If needed, read docs/OPENAI_CUSTOM_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md to guide on you on proper custom tool creation
- If needed, review the last commit 'c82b26e78757c723af89b1080e00e31f56c58154' see previous implementation of a new custom tool
- Expected outcome is now initial testing of directly using Polygon Library API tool calls instead of going through Polygon MCP Server Tools
- This is serve as some initial staging and scaffolding of a future migration TBD to fully implement direct Polygon Library API tool calls instead of Polygon MCP Server tools.  We will start with just 1x direct Polygon API tooll call for now for the initial testing

Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), delete the current file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and then create a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and completely for you to Implement the requested task(s) with Comprehensive Documentation Updates to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info
