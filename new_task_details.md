# New Task Details

Task 1. Use Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Read & Understand docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_fixes_Phase_5_Test_Plan.md to understand the testing plan FIRST

Task 2. Use Sequential-Thinking Tools, Playwright Tools, FileSystem Tools to: execute the entire test plan EXACTLY from docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_fixes_Phase_5_Test_Plan.md.  Generate test report following the specified format and template.  DO NOT FIX ANY ISSUES YOU FIND.  User will later review

Task 3.

# Code\Doc Review Task

- Use Serena Tools, `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix loop until achieving PASSING code review status

# Summary Task

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Atomic Git Commit & Push Task

__MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):__

1. Run `git status` to identify ALL modified files
2. Run `git add .` to stage ALL changes (never commit without staging all)
3. Run `git status` again to verify ALL files are staged
4. Verify specialist work inclusion: ALL frontend, backend, test, and config changes MUST be staged
5. Only then execute `git commit` with comprehensive message

__AGENT PROCESS REQUIREMENTS:__

- Code reviewer MUST verify all specialist work is staged before commit
- NEVER commit without comprehensive staging verification
- Implement explicit git status checks at each phase
- Failure to include all modified files is a CRITICAL VIOLATION

__Commit Requirements:__

- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL : CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHOTS\VIDEOS ETC
- __CRITICAL__: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Verification Task

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

###

Task 1. Use Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Read & Understand docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_report.md to provide more background & context for a new task to scope out implementation of a Phase that the User will Specify

Task 2. Use Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Read & Understand tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md to provide more background & context on proper testing using Playwright Tools for a new task to scope out implementation of a Phase that the User will Specify

Task 3. Use Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Read & Understand test-reports/UI_Enhanced_Playwright_Backup_Tools_Test_Report__25-09-20_22-59.md which is a real test report generated from testing using tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md to provide more background & context on proper testing using Playwright Tools for a new task to scope out implementation of a Phase that the User will Specify

Task 4. Use Context7 Tools for research, Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Based on your understanding of the docs from Task 1, 2, 3, systematically Analyze, Research, & Generate a detailed granular Test Plan using Playwright Tools and saving the test plan to the new blank .md file I just created: docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_fixes_Phase_5_Test_Plan.md.  The test plan needs to validate ALL Phases of the UI Fixes

Review Task 1: Use Context7 Tools for research, Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Systematically Analyze & Review the plan docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_fixes_Phase_5_Test_Plan.md vs. the previous Testing plan tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md & UI Audit report: docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_report.md. Specific TESTS for the new plan need to focus on the UI testing and will be different than the original 3 tests, BUT the testing procedure\rules must match tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md. Fix any issues in the plan if needed

Review Task 2: Use Context7 Tools for research, Sequential-Thinking Tools, Serena Tools, & FileSystem Tools to: Systematically Analyze & Review the plan docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_fixes_Phase_5_Test_Plan.md vs. the previous Testing plan tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md & UI Audit report: docs/implementation_plans/UI_audit_report.md. Specific TESTS for the new plan need to focus on the UI testing and will be different than the original 3 tests, BUT the testing procedure\rules must match tests/playwright/complete_test_execution_guide.md. Fix any issues in the plan if needed

## 🔴 CRITICAL: YOU MUST ALWAYS USE THESE TOOLS FIRST in any particular order to perform all task(s)

- __Serena Tools__: Use for Advanced code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
- __Sequential-Thinking Tools__: Use for Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
- __Context7 Tools__: Use for Researching Best, Robust, & Up to Date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
- __Filesystem Tools__: Use for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications

## Task Description

- Re-run full Lint, Pylint, ESLint and fix all issues. Re-install\Download any dependencies if needed to run the full lint because we are currently setting up a new development PC, so not all tools and dependncies may be setup\config correctly yet
- Expected Outcome is all LINT issues fix
- You can review commit 'e192ee7f4555cda027d557f2c11a119f1b31bd16' for the most recent full Lint run that was performed on the previous development environment to see that linting is fully supported and ran before as long as we have everything configured correctly
- If you hit "sudo" issues where it needs my password, you need to pause and then ask me for the password and wait until i install it with the password if needed
