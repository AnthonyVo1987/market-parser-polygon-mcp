feat: Complete console logging removal for performance optimization

- Remove FileLogService class and console method interception from frontend logger
- Eliminate periodic 10-second log buffer flushing to backend API endpoints
- Remove 3 console logging API endpoints (/write, /status, /clear) from FastAPI backend
- Delete 6 Pydantic models for console logging (ConsoleLogEntry, etc.)
- Simplify backend logger to minimal error-only configuration
- Remove 114+ console statements from 7 MCP test files for clean execution
- Update Vite configuration to preserve LOG_MODE=NONE runtime control
- Restore native console performance eliminating method interception overhead

1. Execute Test plan from tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md and generate detailed test report
2. After basic test plan is done, now perform additional testing to validate the feature by running your own testing with proper tool usage from docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md, and then generate a 2nd detailed test report so I can see the full execution flow and results of your own test plan

feat: Revert Console Log Messages back to Defaults & Retire all Periodic Logging Features for Performance Optmizations

## Requirements

1. Complete removal of the logging feature that saves console logs to logs/console_debug_log.txt file
2. Removal of all the added custom Console Log\Debug\Warn\Error Messages throughout the entire app, so that the only Console messages are the default Console messages.  By removing ALL of t the COnsole Messages we added, this will isolate the app's performance issues to rule out any extra logging going on adding latency, so we will just rely on default logs for now.  This will remove all the extra logging to the backend and frontend servers as well to reduce command latency and processing
3. .env LOG_MODE=NONE will remain as the default for now during app startup since App will no longer allow toggle controls for different log levels

Here's your "Plan: Remove All Custom Logging Features for Performance Optimization" converted into clean Markdown format, with the `│ │` characters removed.

# Plan: Remove All Custom Logging Features for Performance Optimization

## Overview

Complete removal of custom console logging infrastructure to eliminate performance overhead from periodic log flushing, file I/O operations, and console interception. This will revert to default browser/Node.js console behavior only.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Frontend Logger Removal (src/frontend/utils/logger.ts)

- Remove `FileLogService` class - Eliminates periodic log buffer flushing (every 10s)
- Remove console method interception - Restores native `console.log/debug/warn/error`
- Simplify to minimal logger - Keep only basic log level control without file logging
- Remove log buffer and flush mechanisms - Eliminates periodic network requests to backend

### 2. Backend API Endpoints Removal (src/backend/main.py)

- Remove `/api/v1/logs/console/write` endpoint - No more file writing to `logs/console_debug_log.txt`
- Remove `/api/v1/logs/console/status` endpoint - No status checking needed
- Remove `/api/v1/logs/console` endpoint (DELETE) - No log clearing needed
- Remove `ConsoleLogEntry`, `ConsoleLogWriteResponse` models - Clean up unused Pydantic models

### 3. Remove Custom Console Statements

**Test Files (160+ console statements to remove):**

- `tests/mcp/priority_tests.js`
- `tests/mcp/comprehensive_tests.js`
- `tests/mcp/remaining_comprehensive_tests.js`
- `tests/mcp/test_framework.js`
- `tests/mcp/mcp_browser_implementation.js`
- `tests/mcp/mcp_test_runner.js`
- `tests/mcp/performance_accessibility_browser_tests.js`

**Frontend Components:**

- `src/frontend/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Remove `console.error`
- `src/frontend/main.tsx` - Remove PWA console logs
- `src/frontend/wdyr.ts` - Remove React render tracking logs

### 4. Backend Python Logger Simplification (src/backend/utils/logger.py)

- Keep basic Python logging setup for server errors only
- Remove colored console output configuration
- Simplify to minimal `stdlib` logging without custom formatting

### 5. Configuration Updates

- Keep `LOG_MODE=NONE` in `.env.example` as default
- Update `vite.config.ts` to remove console statement removal in production build

## Expected Changes Summary

- ~15 files to modify
- ~200+ console statements to remove
- Eliminates periodic 10-second log flushing
- Removes file I/O to `logs/console_debug_log.txt`
- Restores native console performance
- Reduces network overhead from log API calls

## Performance Benefits

1. No more console method interception overhead
2. No periodic buffer flushing every 10 seconds
3. No file I/O operations for log writing
4. No network requests for log transmission
5. Reduced memory usage from log buffering
6. Native console performance restored

## Verification Steps

- Confirm no console statements in test output
- Verify `logs/console_debug_log.txt` is no longer created
- Check browser DevTools shows only essential framework logs
- Ensure `LOG_MODE=NONE` prevents any custom logging initialization

# Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Use Serena Tools, `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

# Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

**MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):**

1. Run `git status` to identify ALL modified files
2. Run `git add .` to stage ALL changes (never commit without staging all)
3. Run `git status` again to verify ALL files are staged
4. Verify specialist work inclusion: ALL frontend, backend, test, and config changes MUST be staged
5. Only then execute `git commit` with comprehensive message

**AGENT PROCESS REQUIREMENTS:**

- Code reviewer MUST verify all specialist work is staged before commit
- NEVER commit without comprehensive staging verification
- Implement explicit git status checks at each phase
- Failure to include all modified files is a CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Commit Requirements:**

- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

## Tools Usage Guidance

When working with tools, prioritize the following MCP Tools FIRST in any particular order to match the scope & complexity of the task(s), before trying to use standard non-prioritized tools:

- **Serena Tools \ MCP Tools**: Advanced code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring
- **Sequential-Thinking \ MCP Tools**: Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
- **Context7 Tools \ MCP Tools**: Researching Best, Robust, & Up to Date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
- **Playwright \ MCP Tools**: Browser automation for React GUI testing & App Validation
- **Filesystem \ MCP Tools**: File operations, configuration management, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management (use for batch operations, file discovery, metadata analysis, and project organization).  *DO NOT USE Filesystem Tools for for single-file content modifications and instead use standard Read/Write/Edit Tools*

Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations.
