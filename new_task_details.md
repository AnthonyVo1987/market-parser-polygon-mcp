## Task Description

[Migration_DOC] Investigate Phase 7, 8, 9, & 10 Implementation Progress

We were in the middle of implementing all remaining Phases 7, 8, 9, & 10, but hung and froze near the end and I am not sure what Phase finished and\or current phase progress.  So we need to review, research, & investigate the current unstaged and uncommitted files in our repo to cross check them with the Phases to verify progress.  Then I need a recovery plan by commit whatever phases are done, and summarizing status of every phase so I know what in progress or not etc.

Here are tasks to help with the investigation in order to generate a current phase status & recovery plan .md doc report ONLY That I will review and see what to do next.

*SINGLE ATOMIC COMMIT OF ALL FILES AND DOC CHANGES - DO NOT COMMIT MORE THAN 1x for the same Phases.  DO NOT COMMIT UNLESS ALL FILES AND DOC CHANGES ARE FINALIZED AND READY TO BE COMMITTED*

## Research Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

1. Read & Review docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md to understand details of requested Phase Implementation
2. Read & Review docs/migration/DOCUMENTATION_STATE_SNAPSHOT.md for Phase 8 Details, Context, & Background
3. Read & Review docs/migration/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_MATRIX.md for Phase 8 Details, Context, & Background
4. Read & Review gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md for Phase 9 & 10 Details, Context, & Background
5. Read & Review gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright for Phase 9 & 10 Details, Context, & Background
6. Research, Analyze, & Review Implementation Progress for:  PHASE 7: Update Configuration & Dependencies
7. Research, Analyze, & Review Implementation Progress for:  PHASE 8: Documentation Consolidation & Updates
8. Research, Analyze, & Review Implementation Progress for:  PHASE 9: Testing Infrastructure Migration
9. Research, Analyze, & Review Implementation Progress for:  PHASE 10: Final Cleanup & Validation

## Planning Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist perform the requested task(s):

10. generate a current phase status & recovery plan .md doc report ONLY That I will review and see what to do next.

## Testing Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

__Key Requirements:__

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

- SINGLE .md doc report of phase progress so User can review and figure out the next task

*SINGLE ATOMIC COMMIT OF ALL FILES AND DOC CHANGES - DO NOT COMMIT MORE THAN 1x for the same Phases.  DO NOT COMMIT UNLESS ALL FILES AND DOC CHANGES ARE FINALIZED AND READY TO BE COMMITTED*

## Additional Context

- Read docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md for more context & background if needed
