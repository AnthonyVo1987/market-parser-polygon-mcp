# New Task Details

## Task Description

[FIX] Fix ALL Hard-coded Dev Ports\Address through code base AND Environment Variables

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

1. Convert ALL hard coded static Ip Address & Ports from Code, Environment Variables, docs to be dynamic detected - NO MORE HARD CODES
- Hard coded values are caussing false positive failures because sometimes ports change, and the hard code looks at the wrong ports, thinking it is a failure when it is not

2. Docs needs to be update to enforce reviewing the new dynamic ports FIRST, and then pointing all the backend/frontend  to proper ports for proper app running.  update all docs on the REAL working steps to start ALL dev servers and the app  to take into account the dynamic ports that can change

3. Validate fixes by running playwright mcp tests below:

## Validation Tests to be ran VERBATIM USING playwright CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md

- **Expected**: NVDA stock information in any format
- **Result**: ❌ **FAILURE** - HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Duration**: Immediate failure (<5s)
- **Classification**: IMMEDIATE_ERROR
- **Error Details**: Backend API returned 500 status immediately upon request
- **Console Output**: Repeated 500 error responses logged

### TEST-B003: Single Ticker SPY Test

- **Input Method**: Chat message
- **Query**: "Single Ticker Snapshot: SPY, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
- **Expected**: SPY stock information in any format
- **Result**: ❌ **FAILURE** - HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Duration**: Immediate failure (<5s)
- **Classification**: IMMEDIATE_ERROR
- **Error Details**: Consistent 500 error pattern, identical to NVDA test
- **Pattern Confirmation**: Systematic backend API failure confirmed

### TEST-B004: Single Ticker GME Test

- **Input Method**: Chat message
- **Query**: "Single Ticker Snapshot: GME, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
- **Expected**: GME stock information in any format
- **Result**: ❌ **FAILURE** - HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Duration**: Immediate failure (<5s)
- **Classification**: IMMEDIATE_ERROR
- **Error Details**: Same 500 error pattern across all ticker requests
- **System Impact**: Zero successful financial data retrievals achieved

### TEST-B005: Multi-Ticker Test

- **Input Method**: Chat message
- **Query**: "Full Market Snapshot with multiple Tickers: NVDA, SPY, QQQ, IWM: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
- **Expected**: Multiple ticker information in any readable format
- **Result**: ❌ **FAILURE** - HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- **Duration**: Immediate failure (<5s)
- **Classification**: IMMEDIATE_ERROR
- **Error Details**: Backend API failure consistent with single ticker patterns
- **Multi-Ticker Impact**: Complex requests also affected by systematic backend issue

### TEST-B006: Empty Message Test

- **Input Method**: Chat message (empty input)
- **Query**: "" (empty string)
- **Expected**: Appropriate error handling or user guidance
- **Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Proper error handling
- **Duration**: Immediate (<1s)
- **Classification**: SUCCESS
- **Frontend Behavior**: Send button remained disabled, no API call made
- **Validation**: Excellent input validation prevented invalid requests

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last
*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)
*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist
*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- THE EXACT SAME TEST MUST BE RAN
- RUNNING EVEN 1X TEST that is NOT VERBATIM IS A TASK FAILURE VIOLATION AND MUST START ENTIRE TASK(S) OVER

## Expected Outcome

- All 6/6 tests PASSED
- All code fixes, doc updates, test reports, and 6/6 test ALL PASS and everything is committed and pushed atomically

## Additional Context
