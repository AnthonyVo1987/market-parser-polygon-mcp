# New Task Details

## Task Description: [NPX_Test] Phase 1: Playwright "npx playwright test" Single Source Testing Script

# Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach to Review docs & Playwright MCP Testing and Tool Guides to prep for new task(s)

- tests/playwright/playwright_post-mortem_mcp_tools_testing_guide.md
- tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md
- tests/playwright/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md
- docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md
- START_SCRIPT_README.md
- start-app.sh

# Task 2. After reviewing the 2x Playwright Docs from Task 1, Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes etc to perform the requested plan and\or task(s)

- Always read & refer back to tests/playwright/playwright_post-mortem_mcp_tools_testing_guide.md to guide you throughout the entire implementation process for correct & incorrect implementation notes
- Edit\Update 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' based on your research & baseline 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md' test script to properly run the same 3/3 Tests Passing using proper Playwright "npx playwright test xxx" method.
- You will need to create a brand new Playwright NPX Test spec file "xxx.spec.ts" that will run the 3/3 test from 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' / 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md'

Here are the same 3x Basic Tests from 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md' that 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' & "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 xxx.spec.ts" will run:

1. User Input Test: "Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
2. User Input Test: "Single Ticker Snapshot: NVDA, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
3. Stock Snapshot Button Test

# Expected outcome: AI Agent reads & runs testing script from 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' using Playwright "npx playwright test" Method with 3/3 Passing on the very first try

A. AI Agent requested to run NPX Basic Test Plan etc
B. AI Agent reads 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' to perform testing by FOLLOWING VERBATIM testing instructions to have a full successful test run on the very first attempt with 3/3 passing
C. AI Agent properly uses simple one click startup script to setup and confirm dev servers are running and configured correctly before starting any tests
D. AI Agent issues single command to run the new Playwright NPX Test spec file "xxx.spec.ts" that will run and ensure the 3/3 Basic tests PASSES with parity with MCP method: "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 xxx.spec.ts"

# Task 3. After generating the new 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' & "Playwright NPX Test spec file "xxx.spec.ts", perform comphrensive documentation scan of project docs, testing docs, playwright docs etc to update with all the new changes and correct methods

# Task 4. We will NOT test the new test scripts and test spec file yet.  So once all 3 Tasks are finished, we will perform a checkpoint commit to save our progress now, and then will start testing after wards on a TBD follow on task. Perform the final task(s) when ready to save our progress

## Final Task(s) TO BE RUN ONLY AFTER ALL CHANGES\FIXES TESTED & VALIDATED

MUST USE Context7 & Sequential-Thinking Tools to perform: Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- __CRITICAL__: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

__Key Requirements:__

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

AI Agent reads & runs testing script from 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' using Playwright "npx playwright test" Method with 3/3 Passing on the very first try:

A. AI Agent requested to run NPX Basic Test Plan etc
B. AI Agent reads 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' to perform testing by FOLLOWING VERBATIM testing instructions to have a full successful test run on the very first attempt with 3/3 passing
C. AI Agent properly uses simple one click startup script to setup and confirm dev servers are running and configured correctly before starting any tests
D. AI Agent issues single command to run the new Playwright NPX Test spec file "xxx.spec.ts" that will run and ensure the 3/3 Basic tests PASSES with parity with MCP method: "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 xxx.spec.ts"
E. AI Agent generates detailed matching test report following the specific file format & naming scheme after all testing is complete with 3/3 Test passed
