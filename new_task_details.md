Task 3. Based on analysis and & research from Task 1 & 2, SPECIALISTS MUST USE CONTEXT7 TOOLS TO ENSURE BEST PRACTICES RESEARCH, MUST USE SEQUENTIAL-THINKING TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS\PLANNING, & FILESYSTEM TOOLS ARE OPTIONAL FOR EFFICIENT FILE OPERATIONS finish the implementation that wqas interrupted

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

* SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
* Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
* Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
* Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

* Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
* Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
* Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
* This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

* Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
* Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
* the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
* git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
* **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

* Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
* Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
* Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**
