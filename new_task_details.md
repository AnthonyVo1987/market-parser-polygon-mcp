# NPX Playwright Test Execution Plan - Phase 2: Test/Fix/Re-test Loop

## Objective

Execute NPX Playwright tests following **VERBATIM** instructions from `tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md` to achieve 3/3 passing tests through systematic test/fix/re-test cycles.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Verification

1.  **Environment Verification**
    *   Check Node.js version (must be 18+)
    *   Verify Playwright installation
    *   Confirm test file exists: `test-basic-suite.spec.ts`
    *   Verify startup scripts exist: `start-app.sh` and `start-app-xterm.sh`
2.  **Server Startup (Method 1: Recommended)**
    ```bash
    cd /home/1000211866/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp
    ./start-app.sh
    ```
    *   Wait for both terminal windows to open
    *   Allow 10 seconds for servers to fully initialize
3.  **Server Health Verification**
    ```bash
    # Backend health check (must return {"status":"healthy"})
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
    ```
    ```bash
    # Frontend health check (must return HTML)
    curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ```
    *   If health checks fail, troubleshoot using alternative startup methods

## Phase 2: Test Execution Loop

**Loop Strategy: Execute → Analyze → Fix → Re-test (repeat until 3/3 pass)**

1.  **Initial Test Execution**
    ```bash
    cd /home/1000211866/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright
    npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 test-basic-suite.spec.ts
    ```
2.  **Result Analysis**
    *   Capture test output
    *   Identify which tests passed/failed
    *   Note specific error messages
    *   Record response times for performance classification

## Phase 3: Fix Strategy (If Tests Fail)

### Potential Issues & Fixes:

1.  **Timeout Issues**
    *   Verify `{ timeout: 120000 }` is set in all `waitForSelector` calls
    *   Check if AI responses are taking longer than expected
    *   Consider server performance issues
2.  **Element Not Found**
    *   Review modern locator strategies in test file
    *   Verify `.or()` fallback chains are working
    *   Check if UI has changed
3.  **Server Connection Issues**
    *   Re-verify health checks
    *   Check for port conflicts
    *   Restart servers if needed
4.  **Content Validation Failures**
    *   Review web-first assertions
    *   Check emoji detection patterns
    *   Verify response content structure

## Phase 4: Re-test Iterations

### For each iteration:
1.  Apply identified fixes
2.  Re-run the test command
3.  Document what was changed
4.  Continue until all 3 tests pass

## Phase 5: Generate Test Report

Once 3/3 tests pass, create comprehensive report following the template:

### Test Execution Report: NPX Playwright Basic Test Suite

### Include:
*   Execution timestamp and environment details
*   Command used: `npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 test-basic-suite.spec.ts`
*   Server startup method used
*   Detailed results for each test:
    *   Test 1: Market Status
    *   Test 2: NVDA Ticker Snapshot
    *   Test 3: Stock Snapshot Button
*   Performance metrics (SUCCESS/SLOW_PERFORMANCE/TIMEOUT)
*   Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
*   Final success confirmation (3/3 PASSED)

## Success Criteria

*   ✅ All 3 tests pass successfully
*   ✅ Response times within acceptable ranges (<120 seconds)
*   ✅ Content validation confirms financial data present
*   ✅ Complete test report generated
*   ✅ NPX method achieves parity with MCP baseline

## Fallback Procedures

### If persistent failures occur:
1.  Try alternative server startup methods (2-4)
2.  Run tests with `--headed` flag for visual debugging
3.  Check for recent code changes that might affect tests
4.  Review test file implementation for modern Playwright patterns
5.  Compare with MCP method behavior for discrepancies

## Expected Outcome

*   3/3 tests passing consistently
*   Complete test report documenting success
*   Validation that NPX method achieves 100% parity with MCP method
*   Confirmation that AI agents can follow the `npx_test_script_basic.md` to achieve first-try success
```

## Final Task(s)

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

* Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
* Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
* Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
* Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

* Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
* Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
* This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

* Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
* Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
* **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
* the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
* git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
* **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

* Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
* Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
* Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

AI Agent reads & runs testing script from 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' using Playwright "npx playwright test" Method with 3/3 Passing on the very first try:

A. AI Agent requested to run NPX Basic Test Plan etc
B. AI Agent reads 'tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md' to perform testing by FOLLOWING VERBATIM testing instructions to have a full successful test run on the very first attempt with 3/3 passing
C. AI Agent properly uses simple one click startup script to setup and confirm dev servers are running and configured correctly before starting any tests
D. AI Agent issues single command to run the new Playwright NPX Test spec file "xxx.spec.ts" that will run and ensure the 3/3 Basic tests PASSES with parity with MCP method: "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 xxx.spec.ts"
E. AI Agent generates detailed matching test report following the specific file format & naming scheme after all testing is complete with 3/3 Test passed
