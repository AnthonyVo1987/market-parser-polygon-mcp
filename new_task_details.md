<Closing_Tasks> Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, & any other relevant Tools to perform 4x Final Steps for: Review\Fix Loop, Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update, Atomic Git Commit & Push, & Final Verification

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must push to complete the workflow - commit without push is incomplete

### Step 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly committed and pushed
