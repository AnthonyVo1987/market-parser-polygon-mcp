# New Task Details

## Task Description

[GUI] Add AI Chat Response Timer & GUI Component Fixes

1. Add feature to measure AI Chat Response time, and place response time next to the response timestamp.  Now every AI response will show the current timestamp of the response AND how long it took to generate the reponse, with the timer starting the moment a message\button prompt is sent.  Timer needs to be active for ALL AI Reponses, whether Button Prompt or User input

2. Add another developer\debug focused card that should always be the last card\row. For now, the initial debug component will just display the Reponse time of the MOST recent AI Response. This new debug component now shows the Response time that was measured in Task 1, so that user always knows how long the recent response took, AND user can still view the Ai chatbot messages too to see granular response times if they want to scroll up and down the chatbot message area. This will allow for further enhancements in the future where we may want to quickly find out what the latest Response Latency was for the most recent AI response without having to perform convoluted Chatbot text message reponse parsing

3. Move the Copy\Export buttons from the top of the app, to a new row below the quick analysis buttons.  These buttons do NOT belong at the top of the app.

4. Move the Stock Symbol Input to below the user input text box, BUT above the quick analysis buttons row.  Stock Symbol text box is completely in the wrong place and current location creates a weird gap between the Ai Chatbot window and the user input text box for AI chat. It makes no sense to do that.  AI Chatbot & AI User Input for the Chat belong together.  Likewise, the Stock Symbol belongs with the quick analysis

## Research Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## Planning Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
* Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s):

This implementation will provide a robust, consistent development environment with true one-click startup!

## Implementation Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the task(s)

* Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown, perform the requested todo checklist task(s)

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

* SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
* Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
* Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
* Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

* Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
* Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
* Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
* This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

* Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
* Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
* the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
* git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
* **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

* Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
* Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
* Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

*All Files, Docs atomically commited after all tasks are complete*
