Research and Add a new React based front end for the OpenAI GPT-5 based chat bot UI

## Task Description
[Describe the task you want to accomplish]
- Research and Add a new React based front end for the OpenAI GPT-5 based chat bot UI
- /home/anthony/Github/market-parser-polygon-mcp/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/src/main.py


## Requirements
[List specific requirements or constraints]
- We are just prototyping and testing right now, so do not over engineer it
- NO TEST FILES NEEDED because we are prototpying
- Do NOT try and re-invent the wheel - you MUST use the existing main.py
- main.py serves as the python based command line interface backend for the Chatbot
- main.py will have to be modified to support the new file(s) for the REACT UI frontend
the react UI front end is basically a wrapper for the python based back in that just provides a modern chat bot UI for the user
- There will be future task to integrate and migrate to have the same feature parody as our Gradio based code, but for now we’ll take it one step at a time and just build up the code incrementally adding features on top incrementally
- Make sure that any file names or folder names needs to add a “xxx_OpenAI” suffix so that we can easily differentiate project files that are open AI base versus the non-open AI-
- You only have to modify and add the files for the open AI folder based project

## Expected Outcome
[Describe what success looks like]
- End result is we basically have two parallel projects and one the current chat bot and the new open AI base chat bot completely isolated from each other so that the user contest for future parity
- Absolutely no code needs to be modified or changed from the current Gradio based implementation since we’re focusing on the openAI implementation so we’re keeping completely isolated and separate so you do not have to modify anything else

Here is the end result on all the possible user commands if you implemented correctly:
1. uv run market_parser_demo.py
- [NO CHANGES] User can run the CLI version with the "legacy" code

2. uv run chat_ui.py
- [NO CHANGES] User can run the Gradio UI version with the "legacy" code from market_parser_demo.py

3. uv run main.py
- [NEW] OpenAI: User can run the new CLI version

4. TBD new command\file(s) to run the React UI version
- [NEW] OpenAI: User can run the new REACT based UI version with the code from the new main.py
- File name is a placeholder for now
