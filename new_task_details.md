# New Task Details

## Task Description

## Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research & implementing the following

- CLAUDE.md is loaded everytime for the AI Coding Main Agents & AI Team Specialists, so we need to Optmize & Reduce CLAUDE.md Token Usage performance at top level for our project's Memory File for JUST the Optimal Enhanced Tool \ MCP Tool Usage based on all the new MCP Tool Usage Guides:

1. docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md
2. docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Filesystem_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md
3. docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Sequential-Thinking_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md
4. docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Context7_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md

- There are alot of existing critical info in CLAUDE.md, so we need to leave as much critical INFO UNTOUCHED if it has nothing to do with MCP Tool Usage etc
- We will focus ONLY only consolidating, updating, & optmizing anything MCP Tool related ONLY
- So need to review the current CLAUDE.md to figure out what is referencing MCP Tools so we can consolidate
- Need to "cap" the max tokens\verbosity to provide the most critical details about the tool usage that matches optimzied CLAUDE.md guidelines.  We do NOT want to dump the full details on every tool in CLAUDE.md because the Usage guides are there for that purpose
- We will no longer break down individual granular tool usage for specific AI Team Specialists since the new consolidation will be a "catch all" guide for Any Main Agent and Any AI Agent Specialist

## Final Task(s)

MUST USE Context7 & Sequential-Thinking Tools to perform: Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 10 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

*All Files, Docs atomically commited after all tasks are complete*

- There will ONLY be a single consolidated section near the top of CLAUDE.md with details on the optimal MCP Tool Usage guide for each that ONLY CAPTURES THE MOST CRITICAL CORE Usage Details about the tool, and if AI Coding Main Agents & AI Team Specialists need more details about the tools, they can alwasy read and reference the matchinng usage guide

1. Playwright Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Playwright Tools for Optimal Use Cases for any AI Agent for our project; Include instructions to refer to 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md' if needed for more specific usage guide details

2. Filesystem Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Filesystem Tools for Optimal Use Cases for any AI Agent for our project; Include instructions to refer to 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Filesystem_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md' if needed for more specific usage guide details

3. Context7 Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Context7 Tools for Optimal Use Cases for any AI Agent for our project; Include instructions to refer to 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Context7_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md' if needed for more specific usage guide details

4. Sequential-Thinking Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Sequential-Thinking Tools for Optimal Use Cases for any AI Agent for our project; Include instructions to refer to 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Sequential-Thinking_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md' if needed for more specific usage guide details

FINAL EXPECTED END RESULT: Single section near the top that has optmized Tools Usage Guidelines for just 4x Toolsets AND each Toolset has 10-20 lines max: Playwright, Filesystem, Context7, Sequential-Thinking Tools.  No MCP Tools referenced anywhere else in CLAUDE.md.

Example:

- Playwright Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Playwright Tools for Optimal Use Cases
- Filesystem Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Filesystem Tools for Optimal Use Cases
- Context7 Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Context7 Tools for Optimal Use Cases
- Sequential-Thinking Tools: 10 -20 Lines MAX for ENTIRE Sequential-Thinking Tools for Optimal Use Cases
