# New Task Details

## Task Description: Comprehensive Sanity Check Doc & Code Review of Removed Playwright CLI/NPX Testing & Dependencies

Task 1. Perform a secondary Comprehensive Sanity Check Doc & Code Review of Removed Playwright CLI/NPX Testing & Dependencies to ensure complete removal

Task 2. Perform a secondary Comprehensive Sanity Check Doc & Code Review verify & fix that Playwright MCP\Tools Method Docs are all accurate and updated to reflect the new auto-retry methods and NO MORE POLLING:

- tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md
- docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md
- tests/playwright/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN
- CLAUDE.md
- README.md
- ANY playwright* docs etc

# Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

# Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

- All code, files, test scripts, and all documentation completely removed of any references and\or usage of Playwright CLI npx test method
- Playwright MCP\Tools Method left alone with correct auto-rety and removed any incorrect Polling
