# New Task Details

[GPT-5] feat: Research, Review, & Fix\Update OpenAI GPT-5 Chat UI with Best Practices Research using CONTEXT7

## Task Description

Task 1. Perform Research using Context7 & Sequential-Thinking tools to review the entire OpenAI GPT-5 Chat UI code to come up with a Fix\Update Plan to ensure the UI is following the most up to date, robust best practices

- We have made MANY React \ OpenAI Chat UI enhancements, fixes, and updates, so we need to make sure we are following the best modern practices

Task 2. Based on the research & plan from Task 1, implement the plan

ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FINAL CLOSING TASK(S): Review\Fix Loop, Doc Updates, Atomic Git Commit & Push, & Final Verification

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must push to complete the workflow - commit without push is incomplete

### Step 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly committed and pushed

**Key Requirements:**

- Single atomic commit prevents code vs documentation separation
- All changes (code + docs + summary) must be committed together
- Task summary generation occurs BEFORE git commit to ensure inclusion
- Automated workflow ensures consistency and completeness

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome

## Additional Context

- Review the Gradio UI code that implemented a Gradio Based version of the dynamic sizing and scroll bars to get a better idea of what works and doesnt work
