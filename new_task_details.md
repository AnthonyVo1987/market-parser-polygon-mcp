# New Task Details

[DOCS] [GPT-5] Standalone OpenAI CLI & GUI: Vite Migration Research & Implementation PLan

## Task Description

There are alot of old deprecated statements and out dated info across the project docs that reference removed\retired funtionality and features

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Understand the current standalone gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp OpenAI CLI & React GUI code implementation using Webpack
- Understand the more modern "Vite" implementation vs the older Webpack
- Based on the Research Tasks, Research & Scope out a fully detailed granular implementation plan todo checklist so that an AI coding agent can implement the migration plan from Webpack to Vite for the standalone gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp OpenAI CLI & React GUI code

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Based on analysis from Research Tasks, come up with a detailed implementation plan to generate a brand new OpenAI_Vite_Migration_Plan.md doc with all the research and requirements\sections below
- Save new doc to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp folder
- Research from current standalone gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp implementation
- Research from modern "Vite" implementation
- Scoping
- Potential ROI
- Complexity
- Risk assessment
- Fully detailed granular implementation plan with specific examples & real code snippets for the proper migration implementation

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Implement the plan for the new detailed doc
- DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE MIGRATION PLAN CODE CHANGES ON YOUR OWN - WE ONLY NEED THE DOC FOR NOW
- THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT FUTURE TASK(S) TBD ASSIGNED TO PERFORM THE ACTUAL CODE CHANGES FOR MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

- This is a research and documentation TASK ONLY - There are NO CODE CHANGES YET
- DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE MIGRATION PLAN CODE CHANGES ON YOUR OWN
- Entire project is still prototyping, so do NOT implement\focus on: Enterprise Grade, Production Ready, Performance Optmization, Testing \ Test Scripts
- Do NOT over-engineer

## Expected Outcome

- ALL file\doc changes fully reviewed, fixed, committed, and pushed to the repo
- The new doc will be the single source of truth with all relevant info and context so an AI Coding Agent can fully implement the plan to migrate and can refer back to the doc as a reference guide

## Additional Context
