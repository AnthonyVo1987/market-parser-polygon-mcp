# New Task Details

[GPT-5] feat: Research, Review, & Fix\Update OpenAI GPT-5 Chat UI with Best Practices Research using CONTEXT7

## Task Description

<Task 1> Remove premature Testing Infrastructure

- Temporarily shelve, retire and remove the recently added testing infrastructure, since we are still just in the prototyping stage and
- We need to stress that at the moment the ENTIRE app, including the legacy code Gradio & newer OpenAI GPT5 chat and chat UI feature is still in the prototyping stage do NOT need enterprise grade, production ready, and performance optimized features & enhancements at this time
- A testing environment & infrastructure adds too much complexity & bloat right now when the code base will be constantly changing, evolving, & prototyped
- As part of your removal and retirement of the testing feature

<Task 2> New doc for future Testing Infrastructure Implementation

- Generate a brand new document .md in the OpenAI Docs folder that will serve as a future implementation guide whenever we decide to finally implement testing again, so at least we have all the notes down, lessons learned, and a working integration of testing to fall back on once we decide to re-implement later on

<Task 3> New doc for a guide on the current plan & status of the Best Practices Improvments research and analysis

- Generate a brand new document .md in the OpenAI docs folder that will serve as a future implementation guide, status, and research for all the phases
- We will temporariily pause these tasks to re-visit them at a later point after some more prototyping task(s)
- This document will also track the progress of the plan
- Also need to re-organize & move /frontend_OpenAI/PHASE1_IMPROVEMENTS.md to the new OpenAI Docs folder to bring all the related docs together
Phase 1: CRITICAL Foundation & Safety
Phase 2: Performance optimization and advanced features
Phase 3: Enhanced user experience improvements
Phase 4: Advanced customization and integrations

<Final Task(s)> Review\Fix Loop, Doc Updates, Atomic Git Commit & Push, & Final Verification:

### Step 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

### Step 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

### Step 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must push to complete the workflow - commit without push is incomplete

### Step 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly committed and pushed

**Key Requirements:**

- Single atomic commit prevents code vs documentation separation
- All changes (code + docs + summary) must be committed together
- Task summary generation occurs BEFORE git commit to ensure inclusion
- Automated workflow ensures consistency and completeness
