# New Task Details

<!-- User: Add your task details here -->

[GPT-5] CLAUDE.md: Add Review\Fix\Commit steps & new procedure & section for most recent task completed

## Task Description

1. Add a new procedure and section to CLAUDE.md to keep track of ONLY the most recent task(s)

- After a task has finished the review\fix loop, update\overwrite the "Last Completed Task Summary" with the exact details verbatim of the summary report of the most recent task
- By basically copy\pasting the task summary completion and ONLY having a single "Last Completed Task Summary" in CLAUDE.md that overwrites itself, we can keep track of the most recent task that got completed and committed in CLAUDE.md
- By having it in CLAUDE.md, we can start new chats and\or continue where we left off based on the last task
- You may have to modify our custom command "new_task.md" with the new procedure to verify it gets called correctly

2. Update new_task.md slash command to also perform the 4x Review\Fix Loop actions for a commit:

"

Here are the  ACTIONS TO BE PERFORM AFTER ALL TASK(S) ARE COMPLETE that are to be added to new_task.md:

1. Specialist to start Review\Fix Loop until PASSING review with MANDATORY Sequential-Thinking & Filesystem Tool Usage, and OPTIONAL Context7 tool call(s) if review needs any specific changes that may need Context7 up to date documentation\best practices etc

2. ONLY AFTER A PASSING CODE REVIEW, Specialist to perform automous git status, automous ATOMIC GIT commit and GIT PUSH to the github repo for ALL Doc\Code\File changes

3. After commit, Specialist to perform final git status to verify successful commit

4. DO NOT FORGET TO PUSH SINCE I ALREADY PROVIDED A GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN - IF YOU DO NOT PUSH, YOU HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE ATOMIC COMMIT & PUSH!!!
"

## Requirements
