# New Task Details

## Task Description

Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to analyze the plan & provide Specialist Task Assignments per CLAUDE.md to implement the entire plan. @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator MUST assign Tools Usage for EACH Assigned Specialist to MUST USE `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Serena Tools to perform the requested plan and\or task(s)

Expected Outcome:

- @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator assigns Specialist(s) to perform the requested plan\task AND Each Specialist is instructed for EACH task(s) to use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use Serena Tools to perform the requested plan and\or task(s)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT** If @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator provides a Plan with any of these VIOLATIONS, PLAN IS NULL AND VOID DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE, AND MUST RE-PLAN AGAIN:

- no Specialists assigned to any task(s) OR
- NO MCP Tools assigned for Each specialist OR
- Fabricated Specialist(s) that does NOT exist in CLAUDE.md

- Feature: Retire the Emoji-based Market Sentiment code & Emoji Response Enforcement
New Feature Requirements & Expected Outcome(s)

- ALL AI Prompts to no longer mandate the usage of emojis anymore; Reponses may optionally use Emojis and\or by User Request Message to Use Emojis (System Prompt, User Input Prompts, Button Prompts)
- No more code to emphasis of anything Market Sentiment related anymore for Emojis
- No docs reference the usage of Emojis anymore

● Implementation Plan

  Based on the research scope brief, here's a step-by-step implementation plan for retiring emoji-based market sentiment code and response enforcement.

  Implementation TODO Checklist

  1. Discovery Validation

- Tool: find_symbol + search_for_pattern
- Outcome: Re-confirm all emoji enforcement locations in prompt templates
- Target: Validate src/backend/prompt_templates.py emoji instruction lines (520-640)

  2. Remove Backend Emoji Enforcement

- Tool: replace_symbol_body or edit_file
- Outcome: Strip all mandatory emoji instructions from prompt templates
- Target: Update SNAPSHOT, SUPPORT_RESISTANCE, TECHNICAL template methods
- Change: Remove emoji bullet requirements, keep structure without emoji prefixes

  3. Update Frontend Loading States

- Tool: search_for_pattern + replace_symbol_body
- Outcome: Replace emoji loading indicators with neutral text/spinners
- Target: Components: AnalysisButton.tsx, ChatInput_OpenAI.tsx, ErrorBoundary.tsx, DebugPanel.tsx, ExportButtons.tsx

  4. Clean Core Test Framework

- Tool: search_for_pattern + edit_file
- Outcome: Remove emoji detection requirements from test validation logic
- Target: tests/mcp/test_framework.js - remove emojiIndicators validation
- Change: Replace emoji presence checks with content-based validation

  5. Update Test Scripts

- Tool: find_file + edit_file
- Outcome: Remove emoji detection patterns from MCP test scripts
- Target: tests/mcp/mcp_test_script_basic.md and related test files
- Change: Replace emoji wait conditions with content-based detection

  6. Clean Documentation References

- Tool: search_for_pattern + edit_file
- Outcome: Remove emoji usage requirements from user-facing docs
- Target: README.md, docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/, test reports
- Change: Update examples to show plain text responses, remove emoji requirements

  7. Verify Implementation Diff

- Tool: read_text_file + manual review
- Outcome: Confirm all changes maintain system functionality without emoji enforcement
- Target: Review modified files for consistency and completeness
- Expected: Clean removal of emoji mandates while preserving response structure

  8. Final Cleanup Pass

- Tool: search_for_pattern
- Outcome: Scan for any remaining emoji enforcement references
- Target: Search codebase for missed emoji sentiment patterns
- Change: Ensure complete removal of emoji-based market sentiment emphasis

  Expected File Changes

  Core Files (7-10 edits):

- src/backend/prompt_templates.py - Remove emoji enforcement instructions
- src/frontend/components/*.tsx (5 files) - Replace emoji loading states
- tests/mcp/test_framework.js - Remove emoji validation
- tests/mcp/mcp_test_script_basic.md - Update test procedures

  Documentation (15+ files):

- README.md - Update response examples
- docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/ - Remove emoji requirements
- Test reports - Clean emoji references

  Expected Diff Pattern:

- ALWAYS start responses with 'KEY TAKEAWAYS' section using bullet points

+ ALWAYS start responses with 'KEY TAKEAWAYS' section using bullet points

- Use sentiment emojis directly for bullish and bearish indicators

+ Use clear directional language: 'bullish' for positive indicators, 'bearish' for negative indicators

- content: 'Loading emoji'

+ content: 'Loading...'

  Tools Priority: Serena MCP tools for multi-file operations, standard Edit tools for single-file changes, Sequential-Thinking Tools, & any other Tools needed

## Context

Summary

Comprehensive research reveals extensive emoji integration across the Market Parser codebase requiring systematic retirement of emoji-based market sentiment code
and response enforcement.

Emoji Market Sentiment Implementation Analysis

Core Implementation Location

- Primary Source: src/backend/prompt_templates.py (lines 520-640)
- Enforcement Mechanism: Hardcoded prompt instructions mandating emoji usage
- Response Structure: KEY TAKEAWAYS → DETAILED ANALYSIS → DISCLAIMER

Emoji Types Identified

- Sentiment: Bullish and bearish indicators
- Financial: Financial data, institutional, metrics
- Structural: Key takeaways, processing, loading

---
Prompt Templates & User Input

Template Locations

1. src/backend/prompt_templates.py:

- SNAPSHOT template: Lines 520-550 (example_response with full emoji structure)
- SUPPORT_RESISTANCE template: Lines 571-610 (emoji bullet points enforced)
- TECHNICAL template: Lines 628-640 (compact emoji format)

Button Components

- Analysis Buttons: src/frontend/components/AnalysisButtons.tsx
- Individual Buttons: src/frontend/components/AnalysisButton.tsx
- Export Functions: src/frontend/components/ExportButtons.tsx
- Copy Features: src/frontend/components/MessageCopyButton.tsx

---
Documentation References

Extensive Documentation Dependencies

1. Testing Guides (15+ files): All Playwright MCP tests validate emoji presence
2. User Guides: Response format explicitly includes emoji requirements
3. API Documentation: Emoji integration in response schemas
4. Performance Reports: Emoji indicators used as success metrics

Critical Documentation Files

- docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md: 40+ emoji references
- tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md: Core testing depends on emoji detection
- README.md: User-facing emoji examples in feature descriptions

Scope Boundaries

In Scope

1. Backend Prompt Templates: Remove all emoji enforcement from prompt instructions
2. Response Formatting: Eliminate mandatory emoji structure requirements
3. Frontend Loading States: Replace emoji loading indicators (⏳, ⚙️) with text/spinner
4. Test Framework Updates: Modify Playwright tests to validate content without emoji detection
5. Documentation Updates: Remove emoji references from user guides and API docs

Out of Scope

1. Optional Emoji Support: Users can still include emojis manually in queries
2. Unicode Handling: Preserve technical ability to process emoji characters
3. Export Functionality: Emoji sanitization in export helpers remains for user-generated content

---
Dependencies & Risks

Critical Dependencies

- Test Suite: 100% of Playwright MCP tests rely on emoji detection patterns
- Response Validation: Current success metrics based on emoji presence
- User Experience: Documentation promises emoji-enhanced responses

Migration Risks

- Test Breakage: All existing test suites will require emoji detection removal
- User Expectations: Current documentation sets emoji-enhanced response expectations
- API Contracts: Response format changes may affect integrations

# Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Use Serena Tools, `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

# Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
