# New Task Details

## Task Description

[TEST] Run the Corrected 5x Priority Tests and save report

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements
