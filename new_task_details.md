Task 4. After all tests completed running, Use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from comprehensive_cli_mcp_test_execution_report_2025-01-10.md
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run
5. Detect the current real world date and Pacific timestamp
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format: "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 5. Commit & Push to repo the single test report result doc

[CLI_TEST] Fix CLI Button Test Issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

1. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/CLI_BUTTON_TESTS_EXECUTION_RESULTS.md
2. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
3. Based on analysis from 2x test reports, research potential root cause(s) & potential fix(es)

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist:

5. Fix ALL issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
6. After fixing ALL issues, re-run the same exact tests to validate the fix(es) from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
7. If ANY tests fail, need to start the fix\test loop all over again until we get full passing test results from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
