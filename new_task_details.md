# New Task Details

## Task Description

## Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research & implementing the following

We are currently in the middle of streamlining & consolidating Project Docs due to the massive re-architectural changes that have been implemented in our project. Review our legacy archived docs/archived/CLAUDE_LEGACY.md & docs/archived/README_LEGACY.md in order to perform the following for Each doc:

## Task 1. CLAUDE.md - Consolidate & extract\integrate any Critical\Key details from the older legacy docs/archived/CLAUDE_LEGACY.md into our current up to date CLAUDE.md. Make sure we do NOT have any duplicate, redundant, and\or outdated info from the legacy doc.  The current CLAUDE.md will be the single source of truth for ALL AI Agents when working on the project.  This file MUST be optimized for AI Agent Token & Context Usage with the new changes

## Task 2. README.md - Consolidate & extract\integrate any Critical\Key details from the older legacy docs/archived/README_LEGACY.md into our current blank README.md.  Make sure we do NOT have any duplicate, redundant, and\or outdated info from the legacy doc.  The new README.md will be reflect the most current state of the project

## Final Task(s)

MUST USE Context7 & Sequential-Thinking Tools to perform: Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 10 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**
