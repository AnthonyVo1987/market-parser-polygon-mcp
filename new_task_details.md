Task 4. After all tests completed running, Use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_CLI_test_2025-09-10_11-39.md"
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs to have it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run & also include the specific test file names\file locations for EACH test
5. Detect the current real world date and Pacific timestamp
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format, depending if Playwright MCP and\or Playwright CLI method was used to the the tests: "playwright_MCP_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md" vs "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 5. Commit & Push to repo the single test report result doc

[CLI_TEST] Fix CLI Button Test Issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

1. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/CLI_BUTTON_TESTS_EXECUTION_RESULTS.md
2. Read doc to understand the results & issues: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
3. Based on analysis from 2x test reports, research potential root cause(s) & potential fix(es)

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

*ALL TASKS MUST BE PERFORMED WITH MCP TOOLS*

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist:

5. Fix ALL issues from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
6. After fixing ALL issues, re-run the same exact tests to validate the fix(es) from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md
7. If ANY tests fail, need to start the fix\test loop all over again until we get full passing test results from playwright_cli_button_test_execution_report_2025-01-09.md

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
