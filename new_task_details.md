# New Task Details

[OpenAI] Vite Optimizations: Phase 1: Quick Wins

## Task Description

Fully implement requested Vite Optimizations Phase for the Standalone OpenAI CLI GUI Code

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Read /gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/OpenAI_Vite_Optimization_Plan.md to provide more details & context for the task(s)
- Research Implemntation for Phase 1: Quick Wins

1. **Dependency Pre-bundling Configuration**
2. **Server Warmup Setup**
3. **Basic Bundle Analysis Integration**
4. **Development Proxy Configuration**

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Based on analysis from Research Tasks, generate a detailed, granular implementation plan to complete the entire requested Phase

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Implement the plan to complete the entire requested Phase
- Update project docs with Phase Progress

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, documentation updates, and task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

- Entire project is still prototyping, so do NOT implement: Enterprise Grade, Production Ready, Performance Optmization, Testing \ Test Scripts
- Do NOT over-engineer

## Expected Outcome

- ALL file\doc changes fully reviewed, fixed, committed, and pushed to the repo

## Additional Context
