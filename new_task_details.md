# New Task Details

## Task Description

- Perform Post-Mortem fixes for: docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md
- Review supporting docs to ensure all fixes are applied:
- MIGRATION_PLAN_CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md
- ENHANCED_MIGRATION_PLAN_REVIEW_METHODOLOGY.md
- ENHANCED_MIGRATION_PLAN_COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW_REPORT.md

- Delete ENHANCED_MIGRATION_PLAN_CORRECTED.md, BUT move the rest of supporting docs to proper docs folder instead of incorrect top level folder

‚óè üö® POST-MORTEM: Task Execution Failure Analysis

  You are absolutely correct. I failed to execute the task properly and got confused about document scope. Here's my analysis of what went wrong:

  ‚ùå What I Was SUPPOSED To Do:

  1. Take the existing docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md (the one we worked on earlier)
  2. Have specialists review it and provide feedback
  3. Apply their feedback DIRECTLY to that document to fix/update it
  4. Result: Updated ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md as the single source of truth

  ‚ùå What I Actually Did (WRONG):

  1. ‚úÖ Correctly had specialists review the existing plan and gather feedback
  2. ‚úÖ Correctly identified critical issues (over-engineering, resource gaps, prototyping violations)
  3. ‚ùå FAILED to apply fixes to the target document ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md
  4. ‚ùå INCORRECTLY created a separate "corrected" document instead of updating the original
  5. ‚ùå CONFUSED myself by referencing an old 2-week-old document that had nothing to do with the task

  üîç Root Cause Analysis:

  Primary Failure: Scope Confusion

- I treated this as a "create new document" task instead of "review and fix existing document" task
- Lost track that the goal was to improve the specific document we created earlier

  Secondary Failure: Document Management

- Failed to recognize that ENHANCED_MIGRATION_PLAN_CORRECTED.md was old/irrelevant
- Should have applied all specialist feedback directly to docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md

  Process Failure: Deliverable Mismatch

- Specialists gave excellent feedback identifying real issues
- But I created new documents instead of fixing the target document
- The task was "update the docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md" not "create alternatives"

  üìã What Should Have Happened:

  1. Read docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md ‚úÖ (Done)
  2. Have specialists review and provide feedback ‚úÖ (Done correctly)
  3. Apply feedback DIRECTLY to docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md ‚ùå (FAILED)
  4. Result: Fixed single source of truth migration plan ‚ùå (FAILED)

  üí° The Correct Single Source of Truth Should Be:

  docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md - updated with all the specialist feedback I collected

  üéØ Summary:

  I successfully completed the analysis and review phases but completely failed the implementation phase by creating new documents instead of fixing the target document. The specialist
  feedback was valuable and accurate, but I didn't apply it where it was supposed to go.

  Bottom line: I got the research right but failed the delivery. The task was document improvement, not document creation.

## Research Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## Planning Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Based on all the research & newly generated implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist perform the requested task(s):

## Testing Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

## Final Task(s) - SPECIALISTS(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- SPECIALISTS performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

__Key Requirements:__

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

- docs/ENHANCED_10_PHASE_MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md is single source of truth for migration with corrrected Specialist(s) fixes

## Additional Context
