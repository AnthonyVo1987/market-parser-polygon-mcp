## Task 2. Analyze, Research, & Fix Standalone OpenAI Live Server Issues from User Logs

- Live Server Method broken - Could not even run npm run build, let alone run the app
- Is "npm run build" in ANY of the migration or setup\install guides???
- Did you halluncinate previous Live Server GUI because how can you test Live Server if the npm run build command failed in the first place??????
- You really need to explain whether or not you tested Live Server or not and make it work
- Logs:

## Task 3. Create new Post mortem .md doc in OpenAI folder to explain how all these issues got missed even though you claimed you reviewed and tested, corrective actions, lessons learned etc

## Task 4. Update project docs, especially all setup, install, running instructions across ALL project docs with the updated fixes and proper working procedures

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Analyze & Research all the requested Task 1, Task 2, reading any project docs that could also be relevant to the task(s)

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem, Github, & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary & CLAUDE.md Update

- Generate comprehensive task completion summary
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic Github commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
- Github Push commit to GitHub repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must Github push to complete the workflow - Github commit without Github push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly Github committed and Github pushed
