# New Task Details

## MANDATORY Tools Usage Guidance for all Task(s)

Prioritize using the following Tools FIRST in any particular order to match the scope & complexity of the task(s), before trying to use standard non-prioritized tools:

- **Serena Tools**: Use for Advanced code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
- **Sequential-Thinking Tools**: Use for Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
- **Context7 Tools**: Use for Researching Best, Robust, & Up to Date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
- **Playwright Tools**: Use for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
- **Filesystem Tools**: Use for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications
- **Standard Read/Write/Edit Tools**: Use for single-file content modifications, simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for complex analysis, batch operations, and project management

- **If more proper Tool Usage details are needed, refer to & read relevant Tools Usage Guides as needed in 'docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide'**

## Task Description

feat: Add AI Model Selector Drop Down Menu in Debug Panel & Set Default Model to 'gpt-5-nano'

## Task 1. Add a new AI Model Selector Drop Down Menu in Debug Panel to allow the user to select and swap different AI Model on the fly for any new action, and set the app default now to use 'gpt-5-nano', from the current Model of 'gpt-5-mini'.  This can allow user to test out and compare different responses from teh same prompts and\or actions just by selecting new models every other action on the fly before sending the message

## Task 2. ALL Docs need to be updated to reflect the new default 'gpt-5-nano' model usage and new dropdown model selector feature

## Task 3. Checkpoint commit final tasks below to save progress now and then a brand new task will be assigned to perform the actual testing and validation of the feature

# Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Use Serena Tools, `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

# Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

**MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):**

1. Run `git status` to identify ALL modified files
2. Run `git add .` to stage ALL changes (never commit without staging all)
3. Run `git status` again to verify ALL files are staged
4. Verify specialist work inclusion: ALL frontend, backend, test, and config changes MUST be staged
5. Only then execute `git commit` with comprehensive message

**AGENT PROCESS REQUIREMENTS:**

- Code reviewer MUST verify all specialist work is staged before commit
- NEVER commit without comprehensive staging verification
- Implement explicit git status checks at each phase
- Failure to include all modified files is a CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Commit Requirements:**

- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**
