# New Task Details

## Task Description

Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach to Analyze & Review to generate a detailed Post-Mortem report to guide an AI Coding Agent to implement a .md test script just like "script tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md", but for the  the Playwright CLI "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 test-b001-market-status.spec.ts" Method instead. You need to Analyze & Review the successes, failures, misconceptions, lessons learned, corrective actions of the Playwright MCP Tools Testing method to have a passing 3/3 tests from following the single source of truth MCP Tools testing script tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md.  After the analysis, generate a brand new doc 'tests/playwright/playwright_post-mortem_mcp_tools_testing_guide.md' that will serve as a Post-Mortem report to guide an AI Coding Agent to implement the new counterpart .md testing script "script tests/playwright/npx_test_script_basic.md" for the Playwright CLI "npx playwright test --timeout=120000 --workers=1 test-b001-market-status.spec.ts" Method

The end result of the new npx method guide is to have single source of truth test script doc with the same 3/3 tests passing compared to "script tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md" for near complete Testing Parity of either MCP and\or NPX methods

Task 1. Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach to Review Playwright MCP Testing and Tool Guides for some new updates and tasks: docs/MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide/Playwright_MCP_Tools_Usage_Guide.md & tests/playwright/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_MASTER_PLAN.md

Task 2. After reviewing the 2x Playwright Docs from Task 1, Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date: best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes etc to:  Update 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md' with the new Default Playwright MCP Tools Test Plan below of 3x Basic Tests, and then run ALL of these 3x tests according to the proper procedures VERBATIM FROM 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md'.  If any failures, fix the code if it seems like a code bug, and\or fix\update 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md' if it is false failure due to some improper setup\config\testing procedure.  You will run the same 3x tests and fix any and all issues in a loop until all 3x tests PASS. DO NOT MOVE INTO THE FINAL TASKS UNTIL ALL 3x TESTS PASS.  Every start of a new testing loop needs to start fresh and restart all dev servers.  Usse the one click start up scripts for easier dev server startup.  For failures, make sure you review systemtically to rule out false positive failures

Here are the new Default Playwright MCP Tools Test Plan below of 3x Basic Tests to be updated and run from 'tests/playwright/mcp_test_script_basic.md':

1. User Input Test: "Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
2. User Input Test: "Single Ticker Snapshot: NVDA, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity"
3. Stock Snapshot Button Test

## Final Task(s) TO BE RUN ONLY AFTER ALL CHANGES\FIXES TESTED & VALIDATED

MUST USE Context7 & Sequential-Thinking Tools to perform: Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination.
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- __CRITICAL__: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

__Key Requirements:__

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome*

- All 3x new basic tests passed
_All Files except for testing artifacts & outputs, Docs atomically commited after all tasks are complete_

## Additional Context
