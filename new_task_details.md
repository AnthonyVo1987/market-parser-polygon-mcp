## Task Description

[TEST] FIX & re-run Incorrect Playwright MCP Test Plan

- We are going to invalidate AGAIN all the claude test reports. It looks like you I have to spell out exactly the test plan because you are an idiot and have no understanding of correct test plan:

A. Fix Market Status Test

1. What's current market status with Raw Output Format Only with NO verbosity

- Expected output format:
{
  "afterHours": false,
  "currencies": {
    "crypto": "open",
    "fx": "open"
  },
  "earlyHours": false,
  "exchanges": {
    "nasdaq": "closed",
    "nyse": "closed",
    "otc": "closed"
  },
  "indicesGroups": {
    "s_and_p": "closed",
    "societe_generale": "closed",
    "msci": "closed",
    "ftse_russell": "closed",
    "mstar": "open",
    "mstarc": "open",
    "cccy": "open",
    "cgi": "closed",
    "nasdaq": "closed",
    "dow_jones": "closed"
  },
  "market": "closed",
  "serverTime": "2025-09-07T20:56:20-04:00"
}

B. FIX 3x Single Ticker Snapshots for NVDA, SPY, GME, Raw Output Format Only with NO verbosity:  They are MEANT TO BE RUN 3X SEPARATE TIMES BECAUSE IT IS SINGLE TICKER ONLY:

1. Single Ticker Snaphots for NVDA, Raw Output Format Only with NO verbosity
2. Single Ticker Snaphots for SPY, Raw Output Format Only with NO verbosity
3. Single Ticker Snaphots for GME, Raw Output Format Only with NO verbosity

- Expected output format for a SINGLE ticker, so for 3x tickers, 3x requests and 3x separate responses.  DO NOT COMBINE ALL 3 in a single request.  we need SEPARATE:

}

D. Fix the rest of the entire test plan to ENFORCE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TESTING ONLY AND PROMPTS SHOULD BE STRAIGHT FORWARD with low verbosity only

- For Testing, we want single straight forward propt requests with with low verbosity only to avoid timeouts

E. Re-run corrected test plan to generate new test report only, do NOT fix issues

F. Delete ALL invalidated claude test reports

## Research Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Research & Analyze task(s) by FIRST reading project reference guide docs, and then ONLY if further details needed use Context7, and then finally ONLY if more details needed, Web Search\Fetch last

## Planning Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- IF RESEARCH FROM Tasks were NOT performed, this is a VIOLATION and task must be restarted from the beginning
- Based on the research task(s), generate fully detailed, granular, implementation plan task breakdown todo checklist to complete all the requested task(s)

## Implementation Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to Research, Analyze, & Perform the following task(s)

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary & Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

**Key Requirements:**

## Requirements

## Expected Outcome

- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
