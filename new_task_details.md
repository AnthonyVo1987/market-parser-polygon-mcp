# New Task Details

*IF IN PLAN MODE, MAIN AGENT MUST USE @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to generate initial plan WITH AI Specialists Delegation & Coordination assignments; a Plan WITH any Specialists from @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator is an IMMEDIATE TASK VIOLATION AND TASK MUST BE ABORTED FOR NON COMPLIANCE*

## Task Description

[Playwright MCP Method Test Request]

Use Sequential-Thinking Tool as many times as needed & Filesystem Tool(s) as many times as needed to TO PERFORM ALL TASK(S)

- Run ALL tests from gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright using Playwright MCP Method with details below:
- test-b001 through test-b016, 16x total tests to be ran for full 100% test coverage

Task 1. Review testing procedures again before starting & acknowledge: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md

Task 2. Main Agent: Review Full test plan from gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/tests/playwright

Task 3. Main Agent: Review bad test results that incorrectly ran only 7 test instead of the full 16x tests: gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_14-54.md

Task 3. Main Agent: Kill all dev servers for fresh test run

Task 4. Main Agent: Use the requested Playwright [CLI vs MCP] Method to Run the requested Tests following the procedure & format from: "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_14-54.md"

Task 5. Main Agent: CRITICAL SHORT CIRCUIT CHECK TO CONFIRM 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE: Sanity Check that ALL 16x Tests were ran:

- If 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE, Proceed to Task 6.
- If NOT 100% 16/16 TEST COVERAGE, TASK COMPLETETY FAILED, PROVIDE A POST-MORTEM ANALYSIS (NO DOCS NEEDS) WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WAIT FOR USER REVIEW

Task 6. ONLY After all 16/16 tests have completed running for FULL test coverage, use @agent-documentation-specialist to generate a fully detailed granular test report with the following requirements:

1. Match same reporting style from "gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports/playwright_MCP_test_25-09-10_14-54.md"
2. Include ALL testing requirments, such as the 120s timeout PER test, 30sec polling etc, execution time etc
3. Include any details if dev server ports\address needed the dynamic adjustment for a proper run
4. EACH Test needs to have it's own "mini-dedicated section\module report" to add more granular details during that specific test's execution run & also include the specific test file names\file locations for EACH test
5. Detect the current REAL world date and Pacific timestamp for the report file name *I.E. YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md: 25-09-10_13-45 for Sept 10, 2025 at 1:45 PM Pacific etc*
6. Report file name should now be saved in a new standardized report name format, depending if Playwright MCP and\or Playwright CLI method was used to the the tests: "playwright_MCP_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md" vs "playwright_CLI_test_YY-MM-DD_hh-mm.md"
7. Save test report to gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_reports
8. ONLY A SINGLE test report .md doc is needed - every test run will only have a single source of truth for the entire test execution run and test results in the same doc

Task 7. After Task 6 is complete, wait for User to review the test results report

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, test reports, task summary etc
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
