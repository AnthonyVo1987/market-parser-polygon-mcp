# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

ðŸ”´ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
3. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
4. ðŸ”´ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

ðŸ”´ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

<Research, Investigation, Analysis, Scoping Phase> ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE ðŸ”´
Use your entire Mandatory Tools Toolkit to perform focused, incremental, comprehensive, systematic, investigation, analysis, & Research to provide scoping for EACH of following task(s) and\or requirements:

- Create a new tool for our AI Agent called 'get_market_status_and_date_time' using the Polygon Python Library Function "client.get_market_status". Use docs-polygon tools to fetch Polygon Python documentation on how to use the library. You wil have to import the library in in order to call the proper endpoints
- .env file has my Polygon API key 'POLYGON_API_KEY' to use with the new Polygon API
- Update AI Agent Instructions to replace current tool 'get_market_status' to use the new custom tool 'get_market_status_and_date_time' to retrieve either current market status, date, and\or time
- If needed, read docs/OPENAI_CUSTOM_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md to guide on you on proper custom tool creation
- If needed, review the last commit 'c82b26e78757c723af89b1080e00e31f56c58154' see previous implementation of a new custom tool

<Planning Phase> ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE ðŸ”´

Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), delete the current file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and then create a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md' and completely for you to Implement the requested task(s) with Comprehensive Documentation Updates to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info
