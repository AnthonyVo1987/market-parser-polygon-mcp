# Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Use Serena Tools, `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool for systematic approach & Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to perform research to have the most update to date best, robust, modern practices, latest documentation, latest framework(s) notes to Perform comprehensive review
- Optional `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for EFFICIENT file operations and examination (Multi-file operations (3+ files))
- Use standard Read/Write/Edit tools for single-file operations
- Continue review/fix cycle until achieving PASSING code review status

# Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for CLAUDE.md

- Create token & context efficient git commit message of all the changes to prepare for the final commit task(s)
- Update CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section with the VERBATIM COPY of the token & context efficient git commit message between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- This ensures that the git commit message is cached for token & context efficient in order to update CLAUDE.md with, preventing the need to waste tokens by having to regenerate similiar task completion summaries

# Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

**MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS):**

1. Run `git status` to identify ALL modified files
2. Run `git add .` to stage ALL changes (never commit without staging all)
3. Run `git status` again to verify ALL files are staged
4. Verify specialist work inclusion: ALL frontend, backend, test, and config changes MUST be staged
5. Only then execute `git commit` with comprehensive message

**AGENT PROCESS REQUIREMENTS:**

- Code reviewer MUST verify all specialist work is staged before commit
- NEVER commit without comprehensive staging verification
- Implement explicit git status checks at each phase
- Failure to include all modified files is a CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Commit Requirements:**

- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: CLAUDE.md, code files, documentation changes, 1x test report if it exist, NO TEST OUTPUT RESULTS\DATA\SCREENSHPTS\VIDEOS ETC
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT INCLUDE & COMMIT testing artifacts & testing outputs
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

# Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed
