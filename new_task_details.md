# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process

ðŸ”´ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
4. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
5. ðŸ”´ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

ðŸ”´ REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## New Tasks(s) Workflow Details

<Research, Investigation, Analysis, Scoping Phase> ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE ðŸ”´
Use your entire Mandatory Tools Toolkit to perform focused, incremental, comprehensive, systematic, investigation, analysis, & Research using Context7 Tools and\or openai-cookbook Docs Tools to provide scoping for EACH of following task(s) and\or requirements:

---

<Planning Phase> ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: DO NOT START ANY IMPLEMENTATION DURING THIS PHASE ðŸ”´

Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), Generate a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md' for you to Implement the requested task(s) with  Comprehensive Documentation Updates to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info

---

<Implementation Phase>
Implement the granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md'

---

<CLI Testing Phase>
- IF there were ONLY DOCUMENTATION changes, You MUST NOT PERFORM ANY TESTING BECAUSE VALIDATION IS NOT NEEDED FOR JUST DOCUMENTATION CHANGES.
- IF there were ANY CODE changes, you MUST VALIDATE THE CHANGES AND YOU MUST RUN 'test_7_prompts_persistent_session.sh' to perform testing of CLI version, fix any issues until you get all 7x test to pass with 7x different response times. Detect false failures test run\results and re-run if needed.

---

<Serena Update Memories Phase>
Use Serena Tools to update project memories to reflect all the new changes and new app architecture
