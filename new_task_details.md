## Task Description

[TEST] Fix Incorrect Playwrite MCP Timeout Procedure & Update Timeouts back down to 120s

Task A. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Convert the MCP Polygon Timeout to a more visible config type variable\setting so that it is more obvious to change this timeout, because right now it is buried beneath the code and not obvious how to change it. Update timeout back down to 120s from now on since we profiled and 180s is too long since we found out that it was a testing issue and a timeout of 120s is more reasonable

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120 environment variable created for configurable timeout management
- ‚úÖ market-parser-polygon-mcp/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/src/main.py- create_polygon_mcp_server() updated with configurable timeout

Task B. Update CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md Priority Test(s)

- Reduce the Priority Tests to JUST have these 3x quick tests:

1. Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity
2. Single Ticker Snapshot: NVDA, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity
3. Full Market Snapshot with multiple Tickers: SPY, QQQ, IWM: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity

- Move the 8x Button test TEST-P006: Snapshot Button Response Time - TEST-P013: Button Visual Feedback back out of priority.  End result is priority test is just 3x test for now since there are lingering issues with button test that will will fix later on TBD

 Task C. Update CLAUDE_playwright_mcp_corrected_test_specifications.md with updated corrected actions Test Plan Procedures:

- New 120s timeout enforcement for ALL test
- New proper 30s polling and proper timeout detection and timer restart\stop for each test
- ENTIRE comprhensive test plan suite needs to be updated with the correct testing procedure to prevent false positive triggers

Task D. ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Migrate entire market-parser-polygon-mcp/docs/claude_test_reports to proper folder underneath OpenAI docs folder

**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Documentation migrated to proper structure
- ‚úÖ Files now located at `/gpt5-openai-agents-sdk-polygon-mcp/docs/test_specifications/`
- ‚úÖ All test specifications properly organized under OpenAI docs structure

Task E. ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS - Update ALL relevant project docs with the updated & corrected new testing methodology

**Status**: ‚úÖ MAJOR UPDATES COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md updated with 120s configurable timeout and 30-second polling methodology
- ‚úÖ MCP_TIMEOUT_FIXES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md corrected with proper methodology
- ‚úÖ Environment variable documentation added (MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120)
- ‚úÖ FastAPI startup commands updated to reflect 120s timeout
- ‚è≥ Additional documentation files being reviewed and updated

- Perform all of the requested task(s) based on the newly generated implementation plan todo checklist

## Final Task(s) - Specialist(s) to use Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Filesystem & any other relevant Tools to perform Final 4 Tasks

Final Task 1: Review/Fix Loop

- Specialist performs comprehensive code review using `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for systematic analysis
- Uses `mcp__filesystem__*` tools for all file operations and examination
- Optional `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` calls if specific documentation/best practices needed for fixes
- Continue review/fix cycle WITH LINT until achieving PASSING code review status

Final Task 2: Task Summary Updates for LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md & CLAUDE.md

- Generate detailed task completion summary & OVERWRITE the doc "LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md"
- Based on detailed task completion summary, generate high level task completion summary 20 lines MAX for updating CLAUDE.md "Last Completed Task Summary" section between `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- LAST_COMPLETED_TASK_END -->` markers
- Include all deliverables, changes made, and completion status
- This ensures task summary is included in the atomic commit

Final Task 3: Atomic Git Commit & Push

- Run `git status` to review all staged and unstaged changes
- Create single atomic git commit containing ALL changes: code files, CLAUDE.md, LAST_TASK_SUMMARY.md, documentation updates, task summary
- the end result of the commit will be NO FILES LEFT CHANGED OR UNSTAGED - No lingering file left uncommitted whatsoever
- git Push commit to repository using provided personal access token
- **CRITICAL**: Must git push to complete the workflow - git commit without git push is incomplete

Final Task 4: Final Verification

- Run final `git status` to confirm successful commit and push
- Verify working tree is clean and branch is up-to-date with remote
- Confirm all changes are properly git committed and git pushed

## Additional Context

‚óè üîç Testing Methodology Analysis & Corrective Actions

  ‚ùå Previous Flawed Testing Logic

  Major Issues Identified:

  1. Incorrect Timeout Detection - Assumed timeout based on cumulative time instead of actual response completion
  2. False Positive Reports - Reported timeouts when tests actually completed successfully
  3. Poor Polling Strategy - Used full 120s waits instead of incremental polling to detect completion
  4. Timing Confusion - Mixed individual test timeouts (120s each) with cumulative timeouts (540s total)

  ‚úÖ New Improved Testing Methodology

  30-Second Polling Detection:

- Poll every 30 seconds instead of waiting full timeout duration
- Check for actual response completion via page snapshot analysis
- Detect "AI is typing" vs completed response states accurately
- Continue polling until response appears or true timeout (120s) reached

  Individual Test Timeout Management:

- 120s seconds per individual test (not cumulative)
- Reset timeout for each test independently
- Accurate timestamp tracking for start/completion times
- Real completion detection vs artificial timeout assumptions

  üìã Corrective Actions Required

  1. Update Test Specifications Document

- Remove false timeout reports from previous test results
- Update success rates to reflect actual completion status
- Correct performance baselines based on real timing data

  2. Standardize Polling Method

- Always use 30-second polling cycles for timeout detection
- Never assume timeout without verifying response completion
- Document actual response times vs estimated/assumed times

  3. Fix Historical Test Reports

- Previous reports claiming "GME timeout" and "Multi-ticker timeout" need verification
- Re-test problematic scenarios with correct polling methodology
- Update baseline performance metrics with accurate timing data

  üéØ Key Lessons Learned

  Testing Process:

  1. Verify Response Completion - Check page state for actual response vs "AI is typing"
  2. Use Incremental Polling - 30-second cycles prevent false timeout detection
  3. Individual Test Isolation - Each test gets full 120s timeout independently
  4. Accurate Timestamp Recording - Document exact start/completion times

  Performance Insights:

- Multi-ticker requests CAN complete within acceptable timeframes (45s actual vs >120s assumed)
- PRIORITY FAST REQUEST working excellently - all tests completed 43-45 seconds
- System stability confirmed - no crashes during extended processing
- False bottlenecks identified - previous "critical issues" were testing methodology flaws

  üîß Required Process Changes

  Before Any Future Testing:

  1. Implement 30-second polling as standard methodology
  2. Verify timeout configuration in correct location (main.py not pytest.ini)
  3. Clear distinction between individual (120s) vs cumulative timeouts
  4. Validate completion detection logic before reporting results

  For Historical Data Correction:

- Re-evaluate previous "timeout" results with proper detection methodology
- Update performance baselines based on actual measured times
- Correct strategic recommendations that were based on flawed timeout assumptions

  New Testing Standard:

- ‚úÖ 30-second polling cycles
- ‚úÖ Real completion detection
- ‚úÖ Accurate timestamp recording
- ‚úÖ Individual test isolation
- ‚úÖ Proper timeout configuration verification

  This methodology prevents false negatives and provides accurate performance data for optimization decisions.
