# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
4. Use Filesystem Tools for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications
5. Use Standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications, simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for complex analysis, batch operations, and project management
6. Use Playwright Tools for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
7. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. ðŸ”´ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

TOOL OVERLAP RESOLUTION:

- Filesystem Tools: Use for 3+ file operations, batch processing, project management, metadata analysis, comprehensive project operations
- Standard Read/Write/Edit: Use for single-file modifications, simple edits, direct file operations
- Serena Tools: Use for complex code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context
- When in doubt: Use Filesystem for batch/complex operations, Standard for simple single-file operations

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## New Task Details

## Task 1. OPEN and view the image from 'screenshots/image.png' to investigate and implement the following change requests for the UI in later tasks. you cannot proceed with later tasks until you actual view and analyze the image to identify the issues

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: *PERFORM PLAYWRIGHT TOOLS BROWSER TESTING AND VALIDATION ONLY AFTER TASK 7 TO TEST APP WITH ALL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED - DO NOT TEST APP IF NOT ALL CHANGES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED*

## Task 2. UI Fix: Fix incorrect ChatInput_OpenAI user input text box. Text box size is incorrectly sized now

## Task 3. UI Fix: Fix incorrecty app borders\layout\grid because now UI components are no longer properly placed evenly due to teh removed sidebars and buttons.  Things look shifted all over the place

## Task 4. UI Enhancement: Add Expand\Collapse feature to show\hide any of the bottom panel cards, such as the debug panel, performance metrics panels etc

## Task 5. Fix GUI AI Chat responses incorrectly NOT providing the Footer Data for Performance Metrics I.E. Response Time: 23.214s, Model: gpt-5-nano etc.  The CLI version is able to respond with correct footer data and performance metrics, but the GUI, which is supposed to inherit from CLI prompt, is NOT providing the footer data in chat responses for some reason

## Task 6. Update, fix, correct any UI locator names to reflect the new UI that removed Button Prompts and sidebar. This should make it easier fot PLaywright Tools testing to have teh corrected locators

## Task 7. Review and understand the project's current Lint\PYlint\ESLint commands and configuration, and then Run comprehensive Lint\PYlint\ESLint commands for entire project and fix all Lint\PYlint\ESLint issues

## Task 8. Use Playwright Tools to test app in browser. Fix any issues from your testing and re-test until passing
