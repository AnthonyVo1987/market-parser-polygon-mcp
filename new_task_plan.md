# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
4. Use Filesystem Tools for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications
5. Use Standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications, simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for complex analysis, batch operations, and project management
6. Use Playwright Tools for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
7. REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. ðŸ”´ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

TOOL OVERLAP RESOLUTION:

- Filesystem Tools: Use for 3+ file operations, batch processing, project management, metadata analysis, comprehensive project operations
- Standard Read/Write/Edit: Use for single-file modifications, simple edits, direct file operations
- Serena Tools: Use for complex code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context
- When in doubt: Use Filesystem for batch/complex operations, Standard for simple single-file operations

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## New Task Details

<Research, Investigation, Analysis, Scoping Task(s)>
Research Using Context7 Tools, OpenAI cookbook tools, to perform focused, incremental, comprehensive, systematic, investigation, & analysis to provide scoping for:

SOLUTION 1: MCP Proxy with Tool Filtering with ONLY the following ALLOWED Polygon Tools that the AI Agent can use:
get_aggs()
list_aggs()
get_daily_open_close_agg()
get_previous_close_agg()
get_snapshot_all()
get_snapshot_ticker()
get_snapshot_option()
get_market_status()
list_universal_snapshots()
list_ticker_news()
list_dividends()

<Planning Task>
Based on the Research, Analysis & Scoping from previous task(s), Generate a brand new granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist and overwrite the current file 'TODO_task_plan.md' for you to Implement the requested task(s) with ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s), NEVER stop using tools, continue using them until tasks completion, Comprehensive Documentation Updates & Cleanup, removal etc to reflect the latest updates to remove outdated info

<Implementation Task>
Implement the granular detailed Implementation Plan TODO Task Checklist file 'TODO_task_plan.md'

<CLI Testing Task>
YOU MUST RUN 'test_7_prompts_comprehensive.sh' to perform testing of CLI version, fix any issues until you get all 7x test to pass with 7x different response times.  Detect false failures test run\results and re-run if needed

<Serena Update Memories Task>
Use Serena Tools to update project memories to reflect all the new changes and new app architecture
