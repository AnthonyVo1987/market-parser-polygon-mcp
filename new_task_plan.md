## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: MANDATORY TOOL USAGE to perform all task(s) - NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until tasks completion!!!! ðŸ”´

CRITICAL: You MUST use ALL available tools AS OFTEN AS NEEDED throughout the entire task execution. This is NOT a one-time checklist - you must continuously use tools throughout the process.

TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENTS:

- Use tools in ANY ORDER as needed for the specific task
- Use the SAME tool MULTIPLE TIMES if needed
- NEVER treat tool lists as a rigid sequence
- ALWAYS use tools when they would be helpful, even if you've used them before
- Use tools for investigation, analysis, verification, and implementation at every step

MANDATORY TOOL USAGE PATTERNS:

1. START with Sequential-Thinking for task analysis, Investigation, Planning, Scoping, Researching, Complex problem analysis (max 8 thoughts)
2. Use Context7 for research and best up to date Implementation Practices & Library documentation lookups
3. Use Serena Tools for code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context, and memory management for complex financial algorithm development and refactoring; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for simple file content modifications
4. Use Filesystem Tools for Batch File operations (3+), file discovery, configuration management, metadata analysis, project organization, project structure analysis, and documentation generation for comprehensive project management; Use standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications
5. Use Standard Read/Write/Edit for single-file content modifications, simple edits, and direct file operations; use Serena/Filesystem for complex analysis, batch operations, and project management
6. Use Playwright Tools for Testing with Browser automation for React GUI & App Validation
7. ðŸ”´ REPEAT any tool as needed throughout the process
8. ðŸ”´ NEVER stop using tools - continue using them until task completion

TOOL OVERLAP RESOLUTION:

- Filesystem Tools: Use for 3+ file operations, batch processing, project management, metadata analysis, comprehensive project operations
- Standard Read/Write/Edit: Use for single-file modifications, simple edits, direct file operations
- Serena Tools: Use for complex code analysis, symbol manipulation, pattern search with context
- When in doubt: Use Filesystem for batch/complex operations, Standard for simple single-file operations

VIOLATION PENALTIES:

- If you use tools only once and stop, you're failing
- If you follow a rigid order instead of using tools as needed, you're failing
- If you don't use tools throughout the entire process, you're failing
- If you use wrong tool for the operation (e.g., Standard for batch operations), you're failing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Tools used multiple times throughout the task
- Tools used in different orders based on need
- Continuous tool usage from start to finish
- Correct tool selection based on operation type
- No rigid sequencing - only logical tool usage based on task requirements

REMEMBER: The tool list is your toolkit - use every tool as often as needed, in any order, throughout the entire task execution. Choose the right tool for the right operation

## New Task Details

## **PHASE 2 FRONTEND MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT**

# Direct Prompt Migration - Phase 2 Frontend Implementation

## TASK OVERVIEW

You are tasked with implementing **Phase 2: Frontend Migration** from the direct prompt migration implementation plan.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Read the implementation plan document**: `docs/implementation_plans/direct_prompt_migration_implementation_plan.md`
2. **Focus ONLY on Phase 2 tasks** (Tasks 2.1 through 2.5)
3. **Follow the plan exactly** as written in the document
4. **Mark off each task** as you complete it
5. **Use the provided code examples** from the plan
6. **Test each change** before moving to the next task

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

- Start with Task 2.1 (Remove Analysis Button Components)
- Proceed sequentially through all Phase 2 tasks
- Use atomic commits for each major change
- Test frontend functionality after each task group
- Follow the validation steps provided in the plan

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All Phase 2 tasks completed and marked off
- Frontend runs without analysis button dependencies
- Chat interface updated to use direct prompts
- All TypeScript interfaces cleaned up
- All tests pass
- Clean git history with atomic commits

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Do NOT modify the implementation plan document
- Follow the exact file paths and line numbers specified
- Use the provided code examples from the plan
- If you encounter issues, refer back to the plan for guidance
- The plan contains all necessary technical details

Begin implementation by reading the plan document and starting with Task 2.1.
