# Research Task Plan - Test Suite Validation Framework Overhaul

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Research Phase:** COMPLETED
**Status:** Ready for Implementation Planning

---

## Executive Summary

Research completed on refactoring the test validation framework to address critical false positive issue where test script reports "PASS" for tests that receive ANY response, regardless of correctness. This creates confusion for AI agents who assume tests passed when responses may contain hallucinated data, incorrect tool calls, or wrong formatting.

**Solution:** Implement two-phase testing approach where Phase 1 runs tests to generate responses, and Phase 2 requires manual verification of each response's correctness.

---

## Research Findings

### 1. Current Test Script Analysis (test_cli_regression.sh)

**Current State:**
- **Total Tests:** 40 prompts (SPY 17, NVDA 17, Multi-ticker 6)
- **Validation Logic:** Lines 224-250 - Script checks ONLY for "Response Time:" string existence
- **False Positive Issue:** If response time found ‚Üí automatically marks as "PASS" (line 246, 299)
- **No Content Validation:** Script cannot verify response correctness, tool calls, or formatting

**Critical "PASS" Terminology Locations:**

| Line | Code | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| 246 | `test_results+=("PASS")` | Auto-marks every response as PASS |
| 299 | `test_results+=("PASS")` | Fallback PASS marking |
| 315 | `if [ "$result" = "PASS" ]` | Checks for PASS status |
| 317 | `echo -e "${GREEN}   Test $test_number... - PASS${NC}"` | Displays misleading PASS |
| 400 | `loop_status="PASS"` | Sets loop status to PASS |
| 427 | `echo "Loop Status: $loop_status"` | Reports loop PASS status |

**Test Results Summary Section (Lines 310-321):**
- Iterates through all 40 tests
- Displays "PASS" for each test with response
- Creates false impression of validation

### 2. Documentation Analysis

**Files with "PASS" References:**

1. **CLAUDE.md** (line 382):
   - "‚úÖ 44/44 tests PASSED (100% success rate)"
   - Needs update to clarify what "success" means

2. **AGENTS.md** (line 64):
   - "Test Verification ‚Üí Verify 100% pass rate"
   - Needs update to explain two-phase approach

3. **new_research_details.md** (line 124):
   - "100% pass rate achieved with Phase 2: Test Prompt Response Verification"
   - Already references Phase 2 (good!)

4. **.serena/memories/task_completion_checklist.md** (lines 62, 288):
   - "Verify 100% pass rate"
   - Needs clarification that this requires Phase 2 manual verification

5. **.serena/memories/testing_procedures.md**:
   - Documents current 40-test structure
   - **MISSING:** Phase 2 manual verification requirement
   - **MISSING:** Clear statement that script cannot validate correctness

6. **.serena/memories/project_onboarding_summary.md** (lines 150, 216, 431):
   - "100% pass rate expected"
   - "must show 100% pass rate"
   - Needs update to explain Phase 2 requirement

### 3. Requested Changes Analysis

**Task 1: Update Test Prompts (40 prompts)**

Current prompts emphasize historical price queries and technical analysis. New prompts emphasize OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data explicitly:

| Current Format | New Format |
|----------------|------------|
| "Current Price: $SPY" | "Current Price OHLC: $SPY" |
| "Yesterday's Closing Price: $SPY" | "Yesterday's Price OHLC: $SPY" |
| "Last week's Performance: $SPY" | "Last week's Performance OHLC: $SPY" |
| "Daily Stock Price bars Analysis..." | "Stock Price Performance the last 5 Trading Days OHLC: $SPY" |

**Key Differences:**
- More explicit "OHLC" terminology
- Simplified language (removed "bars Analysis")
- Changed "Get technical analysis indicators for SPY" ‚Üí "Get technical analysis indicator DATA only with NO ANALYSIS: $SPY"
- Changed "Perform technical analysis for SPY based on the indicators" ‚Üí "Perform technical analysis based on all available data for Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Trading Patterns\Signals: $SPY"
- Removed some duplicate "Market Status" prompts in NVDA and Multi sequences
- Multi-ticker changed from $GME to $SOUN

**Task 2: Remove "PASS" Terminology & Add Phase 2 Verification**

**Replace With Neutral Language:**
- "PASS" ‚Üí "Response Received" or "Completed"
- "100% pass rate" ‚Üí "All responses generated successfully"
- "Tests passed" ‚Üí "Responses received for all tests"

**Add Phase 2 Verification Instructions:**
1. After test script completes, display clear message:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  PHASE 1 COMPLETE: All responses generated
   üî¥ PHASE 2 REQUIRED: Manual verification of each response
   ```

2. Add mandatory verification checklist at end of script output

3. Add sanity check question: "Did you verify the results of each test prompt to ensure the response was correct and expected with the proper tool calls?"

**Task 3: Validate Changes**
- Run updated test script
- Perform Phase 2 manual verification of all 40 responses
- Fix issues if found
- Re-test until all responses correct

### 4. Phase 2 Manual Verification Criteria

**For each of the 40 test responses, verify:**

1. **Response Addresses Prompt:**
   - Response directly answers the question asked
   - Correct ticker symbols used ($SPY, $NVDA, $WDC, $AMD, $SOUN)
   - Appropriate time period covered

2. **Tool Calls Made:**
   - Polygon MCP tools called appropriately
   - Finnhub tool used for quotes when appropriate
   - Tradier tool used for options expiration dates

3. **Data Formatting:**
   - OHLC data presented in expected format
   - Tables properly formatted
   - Options chains show Bid/Ask columns (not midpoint)
   - Technical indicators show proper metrics

4. **No Hallucinations:**
   - All data appears legitimate (no made-up numbers)
   - Dates are reasonable and within valid ranges
   - No fabricated tool calls or fake data sources

5. **Response Completeness:**
   - All requested information provided
   - No truncated responses
   - No error messages unless expected
