Direct Prompt Architecture for Financial Analysis

This module provides a streamlined direct prompt system that replaces the complex
prompt template architecture with simple, efficient direct prompts for AI models.

Features:
- Direct prompt generation without template overhead
- Simple ticker extraction from user messages
- Analysis intent detection
- System prompts optimized for different analysis types
- User prompt templates for consistent formatting
