## Granular Test Results

### Test 1: Market Status Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity
**Test Output**: üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ üìâ Market-wide status: CLOSED (regular session) as of 2025-09-20 21:21 ET.
‚Ä¢ üè¢ Exchanges: NASDAQ, NYSE, and OTC are CLOSED.
‚Ä¢ üìä Currencies: Crypto market OPEN; FX market CLOSED.
‚Ä¢ üóÇÔ∏è Ticker-specific note: No tickers provided (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT). Per-ticker status can be pulled when you specify symbols.
‚Ä¢ üí° Next step: If you want per-ticker checks for symbols like AAPL or TSLA, provide the ticker(s) and I'll fetch them.

üìä DETAILED ANALYSIS
Current state: Regular market trading is not active across major US exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, OTC) as of server time 2025-09-20T21:21:30-04:00. This means no intraday price updates for tickers such as AAPL, TSLA, or MSFT until the market reopens.
Crypto vs FX: Crypto trading is currently OPEN, while the FX market is CLOSED. If you're positioning around crypto assets (e.g., BTC, ETH), liquidity is available; for FX pairs, expect no new quotes in the interim.
Per-ticker readiness: If you need status or quotes for specific tickers (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT), please provide the symbols and I can fetch the latest data once the market session resumes.
Minimal tool impact: A single market-status lookup was used here to respect your request for minimal tool calls and a fast response.

### Test 2: NVDA Ticker Snapshot Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Single Ticker Snapshot: NVDA, PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity
**Test Output**: üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ üìà NVDA Snapshot: Data unavailable due to API access restrictions; last trade data for NVDA could not be retrieved.

‚Ä¢ üîß Quick alternative: I can provide a formatted snapshot skeleton for NVDA or retry after access is granted.

üìä DETAILED ANALYSIS
Attempted: Retrieved latest NVDA trade data, but Polygon.io responded with NOT_AUTHORIZED (data access requires a higher plan).
Result: No real-time price, volume, or timestamp for NVDA could be shown in this reply.
Next steps if you want a live NVDA snapshot:
Upgrade or adjust your Polygon.io plan to include quotes/trades for NVDA, or
Provide an alternative data source, or
I can present a static snapshot template (open/high/low/close, last price, last update) labeled NVDA until live data is available.

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER
Not financial advice. For informational purposes only. Data access depends on your data provider plan; if data is restricted, I cannot fabricate figures.
If you'd like, I can save a quick NVDA snapshot template to the reports folder and populate it when data becomes available.

### Test 3: Stock Snapshot Button Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Button-triggered comprehensive stock snapshot analysis for NVDA (NVDA)
**Test Output**: KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ NVDA snapshot: Current price, change, and volume data unavailable due to data access restrictions for NVDA.
‚Ä¢ NVDA is Nasdaq-listed; once authorized, I'll provide: Current Price NVDA, NVDA % change, NVDA volume, and NVDA OHLC (Open/High/Low/Close).
‚Ä¢ Actionable workflow: Upon data access, I'll deliver a concise read with trend context, key support/resistance, and volume signals to guide decisions.

DETAILED ANALYSIS
Current Price: NVDA data not available in this session due to access restrictions.
Trading Volume: NVDA volume data not available here; volume analysis will be included once accessible.
OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close): NVDA current-session OHLC data unavailable without authorized feed.
What this means for investors (when data becomes available):
If NVDA price moves above recent resistance on higher-than-average volume, Bulls may have momentum (bearish if volume remains weak).
If NVDA trades below key support with declining volume, risk remains to the downside.
Watch for moving average signals (e.g., price above/below 50/200-day MA) and earnings guidance to gauge momentum.
Contextual considerations: NVDA is sensitive to semiconductor demand, AI compute cycles, and general tech/SaaS demand trends; keep an eye on broader market tech breadth and peer activity.

DISCLAIMER
Not financial advice. For informational purposes only. Data access limitations apply; numbers will be provided once data is authenticated.
If you'd like, I can save this NVDA snapshot as a report in the reports folder and populate it with live data as soon as access is granted.
