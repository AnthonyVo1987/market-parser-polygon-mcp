## Granular Test Results

### Test 1: Market Status Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST NEEDING QUICK RESPONSE WITH MINIMAL TOOL CALLS ONLY & LOW Verbosity
**Test Output**: üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ üìâ US equities (SPY, QQQ, DIA) market status: closed; NYSE/NASDAQ closed.
‚Ä¢ üìä Major indices (SPX, DJI, Nasdaq) status: all currently closed.
‚Ä¢ üìà Crypto markets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD) status: open for trading.
‚Ä¢ üí± FX market status: closed in this session.
‚Ä¢ ‚è± Server time: 2025-09-19T21:59:21-04:00.

üìä DETAILED ANALYSIS
‚Ä¢ Market snapshot as of 2025-09-19T21:59:21-04:00: US equities are not trading today; NYSE and NASDAQ are closed. Tickers SPY (S&P 500 ETF), QQQ (Nas Nasdaq-100 ETF), and DIA (Dow Jones ETF) will have no intraday activity while the broader indices SPX, Nasdaq Composite, and DJI are also shown as closed.
‚Ä¢ Crypto session: BTC-USD and ETH-USD trading are open, so crypto quotes/trades will reflect ongoing activity.
‚Ä¢ FX session: FX markets are currently closed in this window; major currency pairs (e.g., EURUSD) are not actively trading in this snapshot.
‚Ä¢ Practical note for tickers: If you hold positions in SPY, QQQ, or DIA, expect no intraday liquidity today. If you're monitoring BTC-USD/ETH-USD, you'll see active quotes. If you need updates once markets reopen, I can pull last prices/trades for SPY, QQQ, and DIA then.
‚Ä¢ Next steps: Confirm when the market opens for US equities to re-evaluate positions like SPY, QQQ, and DIA; re-check crypto and FX statuses as the session evolves.

### Test 3: Stock Snapshot Button Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Snapshot Analysis button
**Test Output**: KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ üìà NVDA snapshot: NVDA trades at $176.67, approximately flat-to-mildly negative on the session.
‚Ä¢ üß≠ OHLC snapshot: Open 175.77 | High 178.08 | Low 175.18 | Close 176.67.
‚Ä¢ üîä Volume: 237,167,063 shares traded; solid intraday participation.
‚Ä¢ üìä Context: NVDA is near the middle of today's range; watch for breakout above 178.08 (bullish signal) or breakdown below 175.18 (bearish signal).

DETAILED ANALYSIS
**Current Price:** NVDA $176.67 (-0.14% today)
**Recent Change (snapshot):** -$0.24 (-0.14%) per the latest feed
**Trading Volume:** 237,167,063 shares
**Daily OHLC:** Open 175.77 | High 178.08 | Low 175.18 | Close 176.67
**VWAP:** 176.49
**Previous Close:** 176.24

**What this means for NVDA investors:**
‚Ä¢ Trend perspective: NVDA is moving within a tight intraday band today. The close at 176.67 sits above the prior close (176.24) by a modest amount in the data, but the snapshot's stated change is slightly negative, signaling a mixed-day narrative. The absence of a strong directional move suggests consolidation after recent moves.
‚Ä¢ Support and resistance: Key levels to watch are 175.18 (monthly/day low) as near-term support and 178.08 (today's high) as near-term resistance. A breakout above 178.08 with above-average volume would be a bullish confirmation; a break below 175.18 could indicate renewed selling pressure.
‚Ä¢ Volume context: NVDA volume of 237M indicates robust participation for a single session. If future price action tests 178.08 on higher-than-average volume, conviction improves for a bullish move. Conversely, failure to sustain above 176.00 on light volume could imply a pause or pullback.
‚Ä¢ Risk considerations: In the absence of a clear breakout, risk controls (e.g., small-position sizing, tight stops around the 175.18‚Äì176.00 zone) are prudent for NVDA holders or potential entrants.

Investment takeaways for NVDA:
‚Ä¢ Bullish scenario: NVDA closes decisively above 178.08 with strong volume, signaling momentum continuation.
‚Ä¢ Bearish scenario: NVDA breaks below 175.18 with rising volume, signaling potential downside extension.
