### Test 3: Stock Snapshot Button Test

**Status**: ‚úÖ PASS
**Test Input**: Button-triggered comprehensive stock snapshot analysis for NVDA (NVDA)
**Test Output**: KEY TAKEAWAYS
‚Ä¢ üìà NVDA snapshot requested; current price and intraday change for NVDA are not accessible with the current data plan.
‚Ä¢ üè¢ NVDA is Nvidia Corp (NVDA) listed on NASDAQ (XNAS) in USD; market cap approximately US$4.30 trillion.
‚Ä¢ üí∞ Fundamental profile: NVDA specializes in GPUs and AI compute platforms (CUDA); strong data-center and AI-driven growth drivers.
‚Ä¢ üìä Key metrics to monitor (NVDA): market cap, revenue growth, AI model adoption, data-center backlog, and operating margins; price data pending access.
‚Ä¢ üí° Actionable note: Use NVDA fundamentals for long-term positioning; once price/volume data are available, apply risk-managed entry/exit decisions. Would you like this saved as a report?

DETAILED ANALYSIS
Current Price:
NVDA data not available (price and intraday change not retrievable under current access)
Trading Volume:
NVDA volume data not available (volume analysis pending data access)
OHLC Data (Open, High, Low, Close):
NVDA OHLC not available for today; context: data fetch restricted by plan
Recent Performance Metrics (Fundamentals) ‚Äî NVDA:
NVDA Market Cap: ‚âà US$4.30 trillion, indicating a dominant position in AI compute and GPU ecosystems.
NVDA Sector & Industry: Semiconductors & Related Devices; AI/ML compute leader with CUDA ecosystem.
Revenue/Growth Context (qualitative): Leveraged AI proliferation across data centers, high-performance computing, and accelerating demand for AI training/inference workloads.
Competitive Position: Strong multi-year backlog, robust software stack (CUDA, software partnerships), and expanding data-center networking solutions.
Corporate Profile: Nvidia Corp (NVDA) headquartered in Santa Clara, CA; ~36,000 employees; primary exchange XNAS; SIC 3674.

What this means for NVDA investors:
Growth trajectory is tied to AI compute adoption and data-center spend; when NVDA price data becomes available, expect sensitivity to AI demand cycles and data-center capex.
High market capitalization signals broad market confidence, but also implies elevated valuation risk; DCF/relative valuation should be considered with price data in hand.
Volume patterns (when available) can confirm conviction: rising volume on up-moves suggests institutional support; shrinking volume on rallies could indicate waning momentum or consolidation.

Market Context and Trends (NVDA):
AI and data-center growth remains a primary driver for NVDA; any AI platform announcements or new product capabilities can act as catalysts.
Macro risks (rates, inflation, supply chain) can influence near-term price action on large-cap tech semis like NVDA.
Investor education takeaway: NVDA often trades on AI growth sentiment; use a combination of fundamentals and price-structure signals (support/resistance, moving averages) once price data are accessible.
