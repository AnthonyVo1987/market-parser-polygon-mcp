                            Technical Analysis - SPY                            

                                   📈 Trends                                    

 • Price (SPY) is trading around the mid-660s, with recent action showing a     
   sideways-to-mildly mixed trend.                                              
 • Key moving averages:                                                         
    • SMA: 5d 663.09, 10d 665.35, 20d 665.06, 50d 654.67, 200d 604.90           
    • EMA: 5d 663.42, 10d 664.08, 20d 663.12, 50d 653.63, 200d 613.27           
 • Price sits above the 5/10/20 SMAs, and above the 50/200 EMAs, indicating     
   near-term bullish positioning but with limited upside momentum given recent  
   range and MACD dynamics.                                                     
 • Current trend context: short-term trading near resistance band around        
   673–675; intermediate trend supported by above-avg short-term MA levels.     

                                 📊 Volatility                                  

 • Recent price range shows moderate volatility within a defined range.         
 • No extreme spikes; histogram MACD is negative (-1.41), suggesting recent     
   downside momentum in the MACD histogram despite a positive MACD line (2.46)  
   versus a higher signal (3.87).                                               
 • Implied volatility context not directly provided here, but price action      
   suggests a typical range-bound environment with potential for breakout if    
   673–675 resistance is cleared.                                               

                                  ⚡ Momentum                                   

 • RSI 14 is 53.03 — neutral territory, not overbought or oversold.             
 • MACD: MACD line 2.46 vs Signal 3.87, histogram -1.41 indicates bearish       
   histogram momentum despite MACD above zero, implying momentum softness.      
 • Overall momentum appears modestly to the upside in price context but with    
   waning upside momentum as indicated by MACD histogram and RSI around         
   mid-range.                                                                   

                              💡 Trading Patterns                               

 • Support around 652–654 and interim support 660–663; resistance around 673–675
   with near-term fiber 668–670 (between current level and major resistance).   
 • Possible scenarios:                                                          
    • Break above 675: fresh bullish setup targeting recent highs around 673–675
      and beyond.                                                               
    • Break below 654: more bearish tilt, potential test of 650–652 region.     
 • No clear golden/death cross signals evident from current MA relationships;   
   price remains above major long-term EMAs, supporting a bullish bias unless   
   momentum deteriorates.                                                       

                                   🎯 Summary                                   

 • SPY shows a neutral-to-bullish setup with price holding above key moving     
   averages but momentum cooling (MACD histogram negative, RSI neutral).        
 • Immediate levels to watch: support 660–663 and 652–654; resistance 673–675   
   with interim 668–670 as a buffer.                                            
 • Bias favors a continued range-bound move with potential breakout above 675 or
   a pullback below 654 to reassert direction.

Here are the main option walls from the current SPY 2025-10-20 expiration chain:

 • Call walls (resistance/compression points)                                   
    • 670–671 strike area: very high open interest (OI ~10,407 at 670; large    
      tradable volume), tight bids/asks suggests liquidity and potential selling
      pressure near this level.                                                 
    • 675–675+ area: next logical upside wall given recent highs (OI significant
      but not as high as 670 area); watch for breakout above 675 to confirm     
      move.                                                                     
 • Put walls (support/paint points)                                             
    • 660 strike: highest OI on puts (~5,777), strong nearby support cushion.   
    • 656–657 strikes: notable cumulative OI in the mid-600s band, adding       
      additional near-term support density.                                     
    • 652–654 region (not shown in the current put table but implied by nearby  
      strikes with elevated OI): additional downside support if price tests the 
      lower band.                                                               

Key observations:                                                               

 • Heavy put OI around 660 (and nearby strikes) suggests a notable floor if SPY 
   pulls back.                                                                  
 • Strong call OI around 670 (and near strikes) indicates resistance and        
   potential gamma/volatility clustering as expiry approaches.                  
 • Implied volatility (IV) sits in the mid-teens for these strikes, supporting  
   relatively contained near-term moves unless a breakout occurs.               

If you’d like, I can quantify the exact cumulative OI at each wall and provide a
compact “wall map” with arrows indicating probability-weighted risk around these
strikes.

                           Technical Analysis - NVDA                            

                                   📈 Trends                                    

 • Price around 183.22, near the 5d SMA (182.64) and above the 50d SMA (179.57);
   sits between short-term moving averages, indicating a pause-to-mildly-bullish
   setup.                                                                       
 • 10d SMA (184.86) slightly above current price, suggesting a near-term hurdle.
 • Long-term trend still positive given the 200d EMA (152.83) well below.       
 • Near-term resistance around 195–200; support around 177–182.                 

                                 📊 Volatility                                  

 • Recent range: ~177.29 to 195.62 (moderate-to-high volatility within a defined
   band).                                                                       
 • MACD histogram negative (-0.78) while MACD line is positive (1.49), implying 
   momentum has softened despite positives in price.                            

                                  ⚡ Momentum                                   

 • RSI (14) at 51.60 — neutral, not overbought or oversold.                     
 • MACD in positive territory but with a fading histogram, signaling slowing    
   upside pressure.                                                             
 • Overall momentum is balanced with a slight tilt toward neutral to modestly   
   bullish, contingent on breaks of key levels.                                 

                              💡 Trading Patterns                               

 • Support: 177–182; Interim near 180–184.                                      
 • Resistance: 195–200; Additional near-term resistance around 190–192.         
 • No clear MA crossovers signaling a decisive trend change yet.                
 • A break above 195–200 could re-accelerate upside; a break below 177–182 could
   shift sentiment toward a pullback.                                           

                                   🎯 Summary                                   

 • NVDA displays a neutral-to-bullish setup with price hovering above most      
   near-term supports and below a major resistance zone.                        
 • Key levels to watch: support 177–182, resistance 195–200 (with interim       
   190–192).

                      Technical Analysis - WDC, AMD, SOUN                       

                                   📈 Trends                                    

 • WDC: Price around mid-range with positive near-term tilt; long-term uptrend  
   remains supported by higher moving averages; recent weekly move down from 136
   area back toward 115–120 support.                                            
 • AMD: Trend remains choppy but with bullish tilt above key supports; recent   
   weekly close near 214.90 after dipping, with resistance toward 240–242.      
 • SOUN: Trading within a defined low-to-mid range; recent weekly action shows  
   pressure to the downside from 20.07 into the 17–18 area, with potential for  
   range reversion.                                                             

                                 📊 Volatility                                  

 • WDC: Moderate volatility; wide weekly range (115.03–136.20) indicates sizable
   swing potential.                                                             
 • AMD: Elevated volatility recently; weekly high/low spans ~203–240, implying  
   meaningful moves can occur on catalysts.                                     
 • SOUN: Higher relative volatility given lower price level, but recent range   
   compression keeps IV nearer mid-range; notable moves could occur on breaks of
   17–21.                                                                       

                                  ⚡ Momentum                                   

 • WDC: RSI and MACD show mixed momentum; recent strength waned after tests of  
   resistance; MACD histogram modestly negative earlier but not decisive.       
 • AMD: RSI in upper 60s–70s territory at times; MACD shows strong positive     
   momentum but recent pullbacks suggest watchful patience for new breakouts.   
 • SOUN: RSI around mid-50s, MACD modest positive; momentum has been variable   
   with recent downside pressure but not extreme.                               

               💡 Trading Patterns (Support/Resistance, Signals)                

 • WDC: Key walls near 115–120 (support) and 136–136.5 (resistance). Break above
   ~136 could re-accelerate; failure below ~115–120 may invite further          
   pullbacks.                                                                   
 • AMD: Floor around 203–214; near-term resistance at 240–242; a break above 240
   could open 245–250; a breakdown below 214 could test 203–200.                
 • SOUN: Support around 17.3–18.0; resistance near 20.07; a breakout above 21–22
   could shift bias higher; a drop below 17–18 could accelerate downside.       

                                   🎯 Summary                                   

 • Overall, WDC, AMD, and SOUN show a mix of range-bound to mildly trending     
   setups with notable resistance blocks and solid support tiers. AMD currently 
   carries higher near-term momentum risk given nearer resistance and elevated  
   volatility. WDC and SOUN look more prone to range trading unless breaks occur
   at key walls.
