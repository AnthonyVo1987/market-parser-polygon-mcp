      SMA/EMA). No explicit S/R levels computed.                                
    • Reference points you can use (from available moving averages as context): 
      • Support range near short-term SMAs/EMAs around 663–665 (SMA 5/10/20 and 
      EMA 5/10/20 are in this vicinity) • Potential resistance near recent-area 
      highs around mid-670s to 672 (not a formal break/confirm)                 
    • If you’d like, I can fetch price history to derive explicit               
      support/resistance levels (trendlines, recent swing highs/lows).

                            Technical Analysis - SPY                            

                                   📈 Trends                                    

 • Short-term: Price action appears to be trading around the short SMAs/EMAs (5,
   10, 20) in the 663–665 area, suggesting a neutral to mildly constructive bias
   if price holds above these levels.                                           
 • Medium-term: 50/200-day SMAs are well below current area, implying           
   longer-term trend support, with potential for basing if price stays above the
   mid-660s.                                                                    
 • Long-term: 200-day SMA at 604.90 provides strong longer-term support; no     
   breakout confirmed beyond current range.                                     
 • Overall: No clear bullish/crossing signals yet; price remains near key       
   short-term moving averages, awaiting a decisive move.                        

                                 📊 Volatility                                  

 • Implied volatility not directly provided here; price-related indicators      
   suggest modest volatility given near MA congestion.                          
 • Recent price action around the moving averages indicates light to moderate   
   swing potential rather than extreme moves.                                   
 • Risk: range-bound dynamics if price fails to clear immediate resistance.     

                                  ⚡ Momentum                                   

 • RSI-14: 53.01, near-neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold           
   conditions.                                                                  
 • MACD (12/26) = 2.46 with Signal = 3.87; Histogram = -1.41 indicates MACD     
   below the signal line, suggesting mild bearish momentum pressure decreasing  
   but not decisive.                                                            
 • Momentum direction: Neutral to mildly negative within the current setup; no  
   strong upside breakout yet.                                                  

                              💡 Trading Patterns                               

 • Support/Resistance context:                                                  
    • Support around 663–665 (near short-term SMAs/EMAs).                       
    • Resistance around the mid-670s to 672 area based on recent highs.         
 • Crossovers:                                                                  
    • No golden/death cross observed in the provided data; MACD remains below   
      its signal, so no confirmed bullish crossover.

    • No clear chart patterns (e.g., head-and-shoulders, triangles) identified

    • Neutral stance with potential for a breakout if SPY sustains move above   
      ~672 with improving MACD/gap to signal line.                              

                                   🎯 Summary                                   

 • The current setup is neutral to mildly cautious. SPY sits near short-term    
   moving averages with RSI around 53 and MACD below its signal, offering no    
   strong directional conviction. Key near-term levels to watch: support 663–665
   and resistance ~672. A sustained move beyond 672 or a drop below 663 could   
   unlock a clearer trend.

                           Technical Analysis - NVDA                            

                                   📈 Trends                                    

 • Short-term: Price around the 5–20 period SMAs/EMAs (≈182–185) suggests a     
   neutral to slightly bullish tilt if price holds above these levels.          
 • Medium-term: 50-day SMA/EMA around 178–180 provides a support backdrop;      
   current structure implies chop near key moving averages.                     
 • Long-term: 200-day SMA at ~145.55 remains well below current levels,         
   indicating longer-term uptrend intact but needing continuation above         
   near-term resistance for acceleration.                                       
 • Overall: No decisive breakout or crossover signal from the available TA      
   alone; price remains near short-term moving averages with sideways bias.     

                                 📊 Volatility                                  

 • Implied volatility not provided; however, MA congestion around 178–185       
   implies potential for modest swing since price is re-centering around key    
   averages.                                                                    
 • Risk level moderate: range-bound tendencies if price cannot clear near-term  
   resistance.                                                                  

                                  ⚡ Momentum                                   

 • RSI-14: 51.57 — neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold.              
 • MACD (12/26): 1.49 with Signal 2.27; histogram -0.78 indicates bearish       
   momentum on the MACD relative to signal, though not strong.                  
 • Momentum direction: Neutral to slightly bearish pressure fading; no clear    
   acceleration yet.                                                            

                              💡 Trading Patterns                               

 • Support levels likely near 178–180 (EMA/SMA vicinity) with additional support
   near 179.57 (SMA50).                                                         
 • Resistance levels near 183–185 (SMA/EMA confluence) and around recent highs; 
   a sustained move above ~185 could imply a bullish re-acceleration.           
 • No clear crossovers (no golden/death cross) within the current data window.  
 • Signals: Neutral stance with potential bullish bias if price clears the      
   183–185 area with improving MACD.                                            

                                   🎯 Summary                                   

 • The setup is neutral to mildly cautious. NVDA is hovering around near-term   
   moving averages with MACD below the recent price action and RSI near 51. Key 
   levels to watch: support around 178–180 and resistance around 183–185. A move
   above ~185 would strengthen near-term bullish potential; a break below ~178  
   could open downside risk toward broader support.

 • Short-term: Price around SMAs/EMAs (SMA5 119–120, SMA10 120.61, EMA5 122.66) 
   — neutral to mildly bullish if price holds above these.                      
 • Medium/Long-term: 50/200-day SMAs (50: 99.24, 200: 66.17) well below current 
   levels — uptrend intact.

 • MACD + Histogram: MACD 6.49, Signal 7.47, Histogram -0.98 — slight bearish
