1) Trends
- Current price ~677.25, sitting above short-term MAs: SMA5 671.88 and SMA10 
667.49, with SMA50 657.74 below.
- Near-term uptrend potential with price trading above multiple moving averages.
- Key near-term resistance: R1 around 678.50–681.00; close to 678.50 could 
pressure a breakout.

2) Volatility
- Recent range: roughly 657.11 to 678.47, about a 21-point span, indicating 
modest daily volatility within a bullish drift.
- No explicit volatility metric provided; qualitative assessment shows 
incremental upside with controlled pullbacks.

3) Momentum
- RSI 62.53 indicates bullish momentum but not overbought.
- MACD 3.79 with Signal 3.48 and positive Histogram 0.30 confirms ongoing upside
momentum.

4) Trading Patterns / Signals
- Price above SMA5 and SMA10 supports bullish bias; SMA50 well below price adds 
further support.
- Immediate watch levels: Support around 671–672 (SMA5 vicinity); strong support
around 657–658 (SMA50).
- Resistance around 678.50 (recent high) and 680–681 psychological level; a 
break above 678.50 would strengthen upside.

🎯 Summary
- Bias remains bullish in the near term, with SPY hovering near resistance 
around 678.5. A breakout above ~678.5 could open a run toward 680–681. If the 
price fails near 678.5, expect consolidation near 672–677, with SMA5 acting as a
near-term floor.

Here’s an analysis using only the currently available option chain data (no new 
tool calls).

- Current SPY price: 677.25

- Call wall(s) (high liquidity/IOI around several strikes)
  - Strong liquidity cluster near 670: OI ~ 11,019; price proximity makes this a
potential resistance wall.
  - Major liquidity around 675–676: OI ~ 8,989 (675) and 1,769 (676); notable 
because these are near-the-money strikes.
  - Additional liquidity around 672–673: OI ~ 6,299 (672) and 7,057 (673); 
supports a mid-term wall if price moves higher.

- Put wall(s) (high liquidity/IOI around strikes)
  - Very large wall at 670: OI ~ 14,922; acts as a strong put support level 
(floor) and can influence downside risk.
  - Secondary wall around 675–676: OI ~ 5,883 (675) and 1,286 (676); provides 
notable downside protection near‑term.
  - Additional activity around 668–669: OI ~ 5,? (668) and 4,012 (669); adds 
further hedging around the lower mid strikes.

- Interpretation / implications
  - Near-term price action around 677 is encountering a cluster of liquidity 
both above and below, suggesting a short-term consolidation zone.
  - The heaviest call liquidity near 670-675 indicates a potential resistance 
wall if SPY climbs, with 670 being a clear tipping point on the downside if the 
price falters.
  - The heaviest put liquidity at 670 provides a strong downside floor, making a
move below 670 less likely without breaking that wall.
  - If price approaches 670 on the downside, expect support strength; if price 
pushes toward 680–681, watch for resistance due to call wall nearby.

- Suggested reference strike walls (based on current data)
  - Call walls: 670, 675–676, 672–673
  - Put walls: 670, 675–676, 668–669

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing SPY options chain data from current 
quotes.

## Technical Analysis - NVDA

- Current price: 186.26

### 📈 Trends
- Price sits around near-term support at 184.00 and 182.50 (S1/S2) with upside 
potential above 187.47 (R1). 
- Trend remains mildly bullish while above the 5/20/50-period moving averages 
(SMA5 at 182.50, SMA20 at 184.67, SMA50 at 179.59). 
- Key risk if breaking below S1 184.00 could target S2 182.50.

### 📊 Volatility
- Recent range roughly 176.76 to 187.47; current move suggests modest daily 
volatility within an uptrend.
- Implied volatility (IV) around 11–12% for nearby strikes (from option data) 
supports contained, not extreme, upside risk.

### ⚡ Momentum
- RSI 55.82 indicates modest bullish momentum, not overbought.
- MACD 0.87 with Signal 1.33 and negative Histogram (-0.45) suggests a cautious 
pullback/neutral momentum near term, but price remains above recent lows.

### 💡 Trading Patterns / Signals
- Support: 184.00 (S1), 182.50 (S2), 179.59 (S3)
- Resistance: 187.47 (R1), 190.00 (R2), 195.62 (R3)
- Price near R1 but has not closed above; a close above 187.47 could invite test
of 190–195.
- Short-term bias: Neutral to mildly bullish while above S1/S2; watch for a 
intraday break above R1 for momentum shift.

### 🎯 Summary
- Near-term bias remains constructive with a clear support base and defined 
resistance. A break above 187.47 could open toward 190–195; a break below 184.00
could invite a deeper pullback toward 182.50–179.59.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using current NVDA price and existing TA data from

Here’s an analysis using only the currently available NVDA options chain data 
(no new tool calls).

- Current price: 186.26

- Call walls (high liquidity/IOI near strikes)
  - Primary wall around 190 (OI ~ 85,904; near-term resistance cluster)
  - Strong nearby wall around 187.5 (OI ~ 57,313)
  - Significant at 195 (OI ~ 51,444)
  - Additional liquidity around 200 (OI ~ 32,192)

- Put walls (high liquidity/IOI near strikes)
  - Major wall at 185 (OI ~ 35,796) and 180 (OI ~ 30,809) — strong near-term 
downside hedges
  - Notable at 182.5 (OI ~ 11,990) and 177.5 (OI ~ 10,519)

- Interpretation
  - The biggest near-term call wall is at 190, suggesting resistance if NVDA 
rallies above ~186–190.
  - The strongest put wall is around 185–180, providing a floor of support and 
hedging downside risk.
  - Overall, price may consolidate between roughly 180 and 190, with a bias to 
test 190 if momentum builds above 187.5.

- Potential wall strikes to watch
  - Call walls: 190, 187.5, 195, 200
  - Put walls: 185, 180, 182.5, 177.5

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing NVDA call/put chain data from current 
quotes.

## Technical Analysis - WDC, AMD, SOUN

- Current prices: WDC 129.43, AMD 252.92, SOUN 17.98

### 📈 Trends
- WDC: Price around 129.43, with recent week high 130.40 and low 112.52; trend 
slightly constructive when taking the last week range into account.
- AMD: Price around 252.92, trading near intraday resistance at 253.39; uptrend 
previously supported by higher closes.
- SOUN: Price around 17.98,enclosed by a rising impulse from 17.79 to 22.17 in 
recent days; near-term upside potential if 18.98 resistance clears.

### 📊 Volatility
- WDC: Historical daily range wide (112.52–130.40) over past week, indicating 
elevated near-term volatility.
- AMD: Broader intraday swings (214.90–241.20) recently; volatility remains 
elevated with recent large up-moves.
- SOUN: Narrower base but with noticeable swings (low 17.79, high 22.17); 
implied volatility likely elevated around option strikes near current price.

### ⚡ Momentum
- WDC: RSI 64.91 (bullish but not overbought); MACD 5.52 with Signal 6.15 and 
Histogram -0.63 suggests momentum is positive but possibly cooling.
- AMD: MACD 19.25 vs Signal 17.54 with Histogram 1.72 indicates strong bullish 
momentum.
- SOUN: RSI 51.20 (neutral); MACD 0.73 vs Signal 1.04 with Histogram -0.31 
indicates mild bearish tilt or fading momentum.

### 💡 Trading Patterns / Signals
- Support/Resistance context (from latest levels):
  - WDC: S1 around 129.03, R1 around 133.54; near-term upside capped near R1 
unless it surpasses.
  - AMD: Support near 241.95; resistance near 253.39; break above 253.39 could 
shift momentum higher.
  - SOUN: Support near 17.91; resistance near 18.98; a close above 18.98 would 
suggest continuation of the up move.
- Signals:
  - WDC: Positive price action with still-bullish momentum but watch for a push 
above 133.54 to confirm stronger upmove.
  - AMD: Strong bullish momentum; monitor for pullbacks to 241.95 as potential 
entry points if trend remains intact.
  - SOUN: Momentum improving only modestly; needs a break above 18.98 to 
validate breakout potential.

### 🎯 Summary
- The group shows constructive near-term bias overall, with AMD leading on 
momentum and WDC showing steady upside potential. SOUN remains more range-bound,
awaiting a decisive break above resistance. Key levels to watch are WDC 133.54, 
AMD 253.39, and SOUN 18.98 for possible breakout or consolidation signals.
