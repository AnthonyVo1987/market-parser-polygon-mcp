Agent Response:

Here’s a concise TA analysis based on current data for SPY (no new tool calls).

Trends
- Short/medium-term trend: Upward bias, supported by price moving from ~660s to 
~680s and current close near 687.62 (latest month). Key moving averages: 200-day
SMA around 607.44 (longer-term uptrend intact); 5/10-day SMAs around 674.67 and 
669.71 indicating near-term strength.
- Current stance: Bullish but nearing potential consolidation as price 
approaches recent resistance levels.

Volatility
- Price range recently: high around 688.32, low around 652.84 in the past month.
This implies a notable swing but not extreme volatility.
- Implied momentum in range-bound context: bounce potential remains as long as 
price stays above recent supports; wider ranges suggest higher intra-day 
volatility risk.

Momentum
- RSI(14) = 67.71: approaching overbought territory, could signal a near-term 
pause or pullback unless accompanied by stronger upside catalysts.
- MACD(12/26) = 4.82 with Signal 3.75 and Histogram 1.07: positive and widening,
supporting continued upside momentum, but watch for a potential smaller MACD 
push followed by a reversion if price stalls.

Trading Patterns / Signals
- Support/Resistance: Resistance near 688.32 (also near recent high), immediate 
psychological level ~680–685. Support near 663.30 (recent low) with longer-term 
support deeper toward 652–653 and 619–620.
- Crossovers: No bearish crossover evident yet; MACD above signal line supports 
continuation, but monitor RSI for overbought risk.
- Pattern read: The cohort of higher highs and higher lows over the past weeks 
suggests constructive trend with upside potential contingent on breaking 
near-term resistance.

Summary
- Bias: Bullish trend continuation with caveats around near-term overbought 
conditions.
- Key levels to watch: Break above 688.32 could unlock further upside; failure 
to hold ~663.30 could trigger a deeper pullback toward 652–653.
- Risk factors: Overbought RSI, potential consolidation near current highs, and 
macro events.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing SPY data from previous queries

Here’s a concise, no-new-tool-analysis of the SPY Oct-31 options chain data we 
have.

Current context
- SPY price: ~687.6
- Expiration: 2025-10-31
- Near-term price level: hovering around 688

Call wall (upside resistance)
- 690 strike: very high OI (~35k) and strong volume (33k at 690 Bid/Ask), plus 
688–689 area nearby. This is the primary upside resistance wall.
- 688 strike: notable open interest (~9k) and close proximity to current price; 
can act as a minor near-term hurdle.
- 685–686 strikes: sizable OI (≈14.8k at 685; ≈8.5k at 686) supporting a wall 
just below/around current price.

Put wall (downside support)
- 680–686 region: heavy put open interest (680 around 18k OI; 686 around 7.5k 
OI; 685 around 6.7k); acts as strong near-term support cluster.
- 678–679 region: substantial OI (≈7.7k at 678) provides a deeper support layer 
below 680.
- 677–676 area: not shown in data, but nearby strikes around 678–680 reinforce a
multi-level floor.

Implications
- Immediate risk: if price moves above ~690, expect resistance to mount near 
690–692 with potential for a pause or pullback.
- Supported downside: with a strong wall around 680–686, a descent below ~678 
could test deeper support around 678–676, then 670–660 if selling accelerates 
(not shown in chain but implied by nearby levels).

Notes
- These walls are based on current open interest and liquidity at the specified 
expiration. Real-time changes can shift these levels.
- No new tool calls were made; analysis uses the existing options-chain data we 
retrieved.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing SPY options chain data for 2025-10-31 
from the previous response.

Here’s a concise no-tool TA based on available NVDA price/TA data.

Trends
- Short-term trend: Upward bias with price recently trading near all-time/month 
highs (~198). 5/10-day SMAs around 184–183 suggest ongoing near-term strength, 
though recovery paused near key resistance around 198–199.
- Medium/longer-term context: Period high ~198.22 supports a bullish tilt; 
longer-term levels not fully shown in current TA.

Volatility
- Price range month-to-date: ~174.93 to ~198.22; notable swing, but not extreme 
for this name.
- Implied volatility implied byOPTION data at nearby strikes (not shown here) 
suggests elevated premium around current levels; actual IV not provided in the 
current data.

Momentum
- RSI(14) = 61.57: bullish momentum but not overbought; room for continued 
upside before potential pullback.
- MACD(12/26) = 1.47 with Signal 1.35 and Histogram 0.12: positive and 
tightening modestly; momentum remains bullish but watch for a near-term slowdown
if MACD gaps narrow.

Trading Patterns / Signals
- Support: near 186–188 cluster; deeper support around 180–183 and down to 
164.07 on longer horizons.
- Resistance: immediate wall at 198.22 (latest high); nearby 195.6–196.0 as 
additional hurdle.
- Pattern read: Higher highs near current level with a shallow pullback 
potential; no clear bearish cross, suggesting continuation possible unless 
resistance holds or momentum wanes.

Summary
- Bias: Bullish continuation near-term, with potential for consolidation near 
resistance.
- Key levels: Watch 198.22 for a breakout to sustain upside; support 186–188 to 
defend downside.
- Risk factors: RSI not overbought yet, but MACD/histogram imply monitoring for 
a potential shift if price stalls.

- No tool calls needed - using existing NVDA price/TA context from prior queries

No new tool calls used — analysis based on the NVDA options chain data 
previously provided (Expiring 2025-10-31).

Call & Put Wall Scenarios (NVDA)

- Call wall (upside resistance)
  - 390 strike: Highest observed open interest (OI ≈ 249) and notable volume, 
with prices around 0.00–0.01 bid/ask (deep OTM), suggesting a potential wall if 
the stock rallies toward the high strike cluster.
  - 380–370 strikes: Very low OI relative to 390; these are minor walls in this 
data set.

- Put wall (downside support)
  - Put data shows 0 OI across listed strikes, including 390/380/370, etc. There
is no observable near-term put wall in this data set (OI essentially zero), 
indicating weak put-based support from these levels.
  - Note: IV remains high (82%), but actionable put walls aren’t evident from 
the current chain data.

Implications (contextual)
- Immediate near-term wall appears at the 390 call strike in this data (highest 
OI), but the stock price is far below that level, so this is a distant 
resistance in practice.
- Lack of visible put walls means no clear nearby support from puts in this 
exact chain snapshot; support would need to be inferred from deltas, actual cash
puts in other expiries, or updated data.

Notes
- Walls are derived from open interest and liquidity in the provided chain 
snapshot; real-time shifts can change these levels.
- If you want a more actionable near-term view, we’d need a chain with strikes 
closer to the current price (around 180–210) and updated OI.

Tools Used:
- No new tool calls needed - using existing NVDA options chain data for 
2025-10-31.

Here’s a concise no-tool TA synthesis for WDC, AMD, and SOUN based on current 
price data and prior TA data.

WDC (Western Digital)
- Trends: Near-term bullish bias with price around 124–126; resistance near 
126.82 and 133.54 on larger view. Longer-term context mixed due to gaps in 
SMA/EMA data.
- Volatility: Recent range ~121.85–133.54; notable intra-day swings but not 
extreme.
- Momentum: RSI around 60–61 suggests ongoing upside but not overbought; MACD 
positive but recent histogram hints at slowing momentum.
- Trading Patterns / Signals: Support around 121.85, 117.23; resistance first at
126.82, then 133.54. Possible short-term pullback risk if 126.82 holds as a 
ceiling.
- Key levels: Support 121.85; Resistance 126.82 → 133.54.

AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)
- Trends: Upward bias with current around 260; intraday/near-term resistance 
near 264.58; room for further upside if that level breaks.
- Volatility: Broad daily swings (low ~258, high ~264) in a tight range; implied
volatility not explicitly quantified here but options activity shows active 
interest around recent moves.
- Momentum: RSI near 75 (from prior TA), indicating strong momentum; MACD 
positive with robust strength, though watch for a potential near-term pullback 
if overextended.
- Trading Patterns / Signals: Supports around 258.03 (yesterday/near-term); 
249.80 as deeper support from last week. Break above 264.58 could signal 
continued upside.
- Key levels: Support 258.03; Resistance 264.58 → 253.39 (next overhead swing 
from last week’s data).

SOUN (SoundHound AI)
- Trends: Recently hovering around the 18 range; near-term trend could tilt with
movement beyond 18.62 resistance.
- Volatility: Wide intraday range in recent data (low ~16.56, high ~19.09); 
volatility elevated relative to price.
- Momentum: MACD around 0.66 with negative momentum in recent days; RSI data 
less complete but implied modest momentum.
- Trading Patterns / Signals: Support around 17.98; deeper support near 16.56. 
Resistance around 18.62 and 19.09–19.50 region.
- Key levels: Support 17.98; Resistance 18.62 → 19.09/19.50.

Notes
- Walls and levels are derived from recent highs/lows and price context; 
real-time moves can shift these levels.
- No new tool calls were made; analysis uses existing price/TA context for the 
three names.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing price/TA context for WDC, AMD, and SOUN.
