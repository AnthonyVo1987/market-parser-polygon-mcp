SPY Technical Analysis (No new tool calls; based on current/previous data)

Trends
- Price is above the short-term SMA(5) = 677.82 and SMA(20) = 669.60, indicating
a bullish intermediate trend.
- Longer-term anchor: SMA(200) at 607.98 remains well below current price, 
supporting a sustained uptrend.

Volatility
- Recent range (approx. last 3 months): high 689.70, low 619.29; current price 
around 687.39.
- Range suggests elevated volatility but a directional bias remains bullish as 
price sits near upper end of range.

Momentum
- RSI(14) at 68.77 indicates strong momentum but not extreme overbought yet.
- MACD(12/26) = 5.72 with Signal = 4.14; Histogram = 1.58, both positive, 
supporting upside momentum.

Trading Patterns / Signals
- Breakout risk: Near-term resistance around 689.70 (recent high); a close above
this level could unlock upside toward 700+ (psych level).
- Support framework: Immediate support around 663.30 (recent 5-day low) with 
stronger support near 652.84 and 619.29 below.
- No bearish crossovers observed in current TA data; trend signals remain 
buy-leaning barring a break below key supports.

Bottom line: The setup shows a bullish trend with positive momentum and a 
favorable risk-reward if price holds above near-term support and test resistance
around 689.70. A sustained move above 689.70 could open toward the 700+ area; 
failure below 663.30 would weaken the view.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing SPY data from previous queries

SPY Options Wall (based on current 2025-10-31 expiration chain data; no new tool
calls)

Call Wall candidates (high open interest around key strikes near current price 
687.39)
- 690: High OI (~45,569) with sizable IV; near-term resistance wall
- 697–696: Notable OI (6k–8k range) but less pronounced than 690; secondary wall
- 689–688: Moderate activity; potential minor near-term hurdle

Put Wall candidates
- 680: Very large OI (~33,734); strong put wall just below current price
- 681–682: Substantial OI (2k–4.5k range); adds support cluster around 680–682
- 679–678: Additional open interest; reinforces nearby support around 678–679

Key takeaway
- A pronounced call wall at 690–691 suggests potential resistance around that 
level.
- A pronounced put wall at 680–681 suggests support around that zone.
- The price is near the middle of these walls, implying a consolidation range 
with potential move if price breaks either wall.

Notes: Walls are inferred from open interest concentration and proximity to 
current price; not a formal model.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing SPY options chain data from Tradier

**Response Formatting:**

NVDA Technical Analysis (No new tool calls; based on current/previous data)

Trends
- Price is above short-term SMA(5)=188.24 and SMA(10)=184.99, indicating a 
bullish short- to mid-term trend.
- Price well above long-term SMA(200)=147.16, supporting a sustained uptrend.

Volatility
- Price range (recent): High 212.19, Low 164.07 over the observed window; 
current price ~207.04 sits near the upper end, implying elevated volatility with
upside bias but local resistance ahead.

Momentum
- RSI(14) = 69.41, approaching overbought territory.
- MACD(12/26) = 2.69; Signal = 1.62; Histogram = 1.07, all positive, signaling 
bullish momentum but with potential for a near-term pullback if overbought.

Trading Patterns / Signals
- Resistance: 212.19 (period high) is a key nearby hurdle; a daily close above 
this could open moves toward higher levels.
- Support: 176.76 (5-day low) and 164.07 (3-month low) provide downside 
cushions; a break below 176.76 could shift the bias.
- No bearish crossovers observed; trend remains buy-leaning unless price breaks 
below support cluster.

Bottom line
- The setup shows a bullish trend with positive momentum, but RSI near 
overbought and a clear resistance at 212.19; a break above 212.19 would validate
upside continuation, while failure to hold 176.76 could threaten the uptrend.

NVDA Options Chain Walls (no new tool calls; based on current 2025-10-31 
expiration data)

Call Wall candidates (high open interest near current price ~207.04)
- Primary near-term wall: 210–212.5 area
  - 210: OI ~54,713; Delta ~0.42; suggests resistance around 210
  - 212.50: OI ~23,933; Delta ~0.34; additional nearby resistance
  - 217.50–225 region also active (OI in the tens of thousands) but farther from
current price; potential upside hurdle if breached

Put Wall candidates
- Strong support cluster around 185–190
  - 190: OI ~39,691; Delta ~-0.11; solid near-term put cushion
  - 187.50: OI ~46,929; Delta ~-0.09; additional support
  - 185: OI ~37,981; Delta ~-0.07; reinforces 185–187.5 zone
- 182.50 and 195 also contribute to nearby walls

Key takeaways
- Call wall: notable resistance around 210–212.5, with additional overhead in 
the 217–225 area if price advances.
- Put wall: strong support around 185–190, helping cushion declines; secondary 
support near 182.5.
- Current price sits between these clusters, implying a potential consolidation 
unless price breaks either wall with a sustained move.

Notes
- Walls are inferred from open interest proximity to current price; not a formal
model.
- IV is elevated, contributing to option premium, especially near the 190–210 
area.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing NVDA options chain data from Tradier

NVDA? (No — WDC, AMD, SOUN) Technical Analysis (No tool calls; based on current 
price & TA data)

Trends
- WDC: Price near recent highs; no clear breach of minor short-term resistance 
yet. Long-term levels suggest mixed to bullish bias if 132–145 area holds.
- AMD: Strong bullish momentum; price testing near-term resistance around 
267–270 after climbing from mid-260s.
- SOUN: Oscillating within lower range; no clear breakout, but structure 
supports a potential move if 19–20 resistance area is tested.

Volatility
- WDC: Range recently wide (low ~117–high ~145); elevated IV implied around 
recent moves.
- AMD: Higher volatility tone; large intraday swings around 260–270.
- SOUN: Lower absolute price, but IV elevated relative to price; daily ranges 
~17–20.

Momentum
- WDC: RSI ~58.5 (moderate bullish; not overbought). MACD positive; bullish 
tilt, watch for if MACD crosses above previous high.
- AMD: RSI ~73.6 (near overbought); MACD positive in data; momentum strong but 
risk of near-term pullbacks.
- SOUN: RSI ~49.5 (neutral); MACD ~0.54 positive; momentum modest.

Trading Patterns / Signals
- Walls/levels (from current data):
  - WDC: Resistance near 133.54; overhead in 141–145; Support near 124.92 and 
117.23.
  - AMD: Resistance near 267.08; next resistance 270–275; Support around 253.39 
and 236–240.
  - SOUN: Resistance near 20.17; nearby psychological ~21–22; Support around 
17.71 and 16.56.
- Signals: No bearish crossovers indicated across all three; trend bias remains 
bullish for WDC/AMD if supports hold; SOUN needs a breakout above 20–21 to shift
bias.

Bottom line
- WDC shows a constructive trend with upside potential if 133.54/141–145 walls 
hold.
- AMD demonstrates strong upside potential but watch for overbought risk near 
the 270+ zone.
- SOUN remains range-bound; a breakout above the 20–21 area could unlock upside;
otherwise expect consolidation.

Notes
- Wall levels are approximate from price ranges and key levels; not a formal 
model.
- Elevated IV can shift walls; monitor price action around stated levels.

Tools Used:
- No tool calls needed - using existing price & TA data from prior queries
