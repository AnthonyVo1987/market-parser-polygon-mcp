SPY Support & Resistance (based on recent OHLC data)

- Immediate support: 675.65–658.14 (recent intraday lows; strong zone around 
660–665)
- Nearby resistance: 689.70 (recent period high), with a secondary near 700 
psychological level

Notes:
- Break above 689.70 could open to ~700+; break below 675 could test 663–660 
support area.
- These are approximate levels derived from recent high/low ranges; use with 
price action confirmation.

Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Trading Patterns for SPY (based on current price 
and existing TA data)

- Trends
  - Price is above long-term SMA50 (661.24) but slightly below short-term SMA5 
(683.35) and near SMA10 (676.33). Overall uptrend remains, with near-term 
consolidation possible around the 675–685 area.
  - Nearby resistance at 689.70; break could open toward 700+. Support around 
675.65–663.30 zone.

- Volatility
  - Recent intraday range: 675.65 to 689.70 (about 14 points). Range implies 
moderate volatility; no extreme moves visible yet.
  - Current price well above the lower bound of the range, suggesting intact 
near-term upside potential if the breakout occurs.

- Momentum
  - RSI 59.66 (neutral-to-bullish); not overbought, leaving room for upside.
  - MACD 6.23 with a positive Signal 4.92 and Histogram 1.31 indicates bullish 
momentum, though not accelerating aggressively.

- Trading Patterns / Signals
  - Price trading around SMA10 and just below SMA5; bull case improves if SPY 
clears 689.70 with a close above it.
  - If price fails below 675–663 zone, risk of a test of stronger support 
~660–663.
  - Break above 689.70 could target ~700+; failure below 675 could reassert the 
663–660 area.

Bottom line (no new data/tools used): The setup shows constructive near-term 
momentum with resistance overhead at 689.70. Manage risk with a close above 
689.70 to confirm the breakout; otherwise watch for a test of ~675–660 support.

SPY Options Chain walls (based on current data for 2025-10-31)

- Call walls (resistance zones implied by high open interest):
  - Around 680–681: large OI near 33,310 at 680 in calls; nearby strikes 679–681
show notable activity.
  - Near 689–689.50: high strike resistance with rising OI/volume toward upper 
end of week; 689 shows notable activity.

- Put walls (support zones implied by high open interest):
  - Around 670: very large OI (≈40,745) at 670 puts, indicating strong near-term
support at or near 670.
  - Around 675: substantial OI (≈15,723) at 675 puts, reinforcing a support 
cluster around mid-670s.

Notes:
- Walls are derived from observed open interest and volume concentrations in the
current chain (expiring this Friday). Breaks beyond call walls (e.g., above 689)
could target 700+; breaks below put walls (e.g., below 670) could test the 
663–660 area.
- These levels are approximate and should be used with price action 
confirmation.

NVDA Support & Resistance (based on current and recent price data)

- Immediate resistance: 206–212 (recent high in Oct; 212.19 is the 3-month high)
- Near-term resistance/psych level: around 200–205
- Nearby support: 184–190 (recent consolidation area; near 187.56 SMA14/price 
region)
- Stronger support: 176–180 (recent swing low in the last 2–3 weeks)
- Longer-term bounds: 164–170 (3-month low region)

Notes:
- A move above ~212 could open toward 220+; a break below ~184–190 could test 
176–180.
- Levels are approximate and should be confirmed with price action and volume.

Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Trading Patterns for NVDA (based on current price 
and existing TA data)

- Trends
  - Price around the 50-day SMA region (SMA50 ~181.37) and above there; 
near-term consolidation possible around 186–206.
  - Immediate resistance around 206–212 (212.19 is the 3-month high); support 
around 184–190 (near SMA20 at 187.56).

- Volatility
  - Historical range roughly 164–212 over the last 3 months; current range 
suggests moderate volatility with no extreme breakout yet.
  - Current price near the upper half of the recent range, implying upside 
potential if buyers step in above 206–212.

- Momentum
  - RSI about 67.04 (near overbought territory but not extreme); supports 
continued upside with caution near 70+.
  - MACD (4.81) above Signal (2.65) with Histogram ~2.15 indicates bullish 
momentum, not overly aggressive.

- Trading Patterns / Signals
  - Price remains above long-term trend anchors but has not decisively cleared 
the 212 resistance; a close above 212 could open toward 220+.
  - Key support zones: 184–190 (near SMA20); stronger support around 176–180 if 
a deeper pullback occurs.
  - Watch for a breakout above 212 or a pullback below 190-184 to determine 
near-term direction.

Bottom line: Constructive near-term momentum with resistance overhead at 
206–212. Break above 212 could push toward 220+, while a break below 184–190 
could test 176–180.

NVDA Options Chain walls (no new tools)

Based on current NVDA call/put chains expiring 2025-10-31, the notable wall 
levels (high open interest and liquidity concentrations) are:

- Call walls (resistance zones)
  - Primary: 200–210 strike area (largest clusters around 200.0, 205.0, and 
210.0)
  - Secondary: around 195–190 ( supporting near-term resistance if price moves 
lower)

- Put walls (support zones)
  - Primary: 190–200 strike area (high OI at 190, 195, and 200)
  - Stronger: 180–190 (notable OI, reinforcing a floor around the 180s)

Notes:
- Break above 210 could open toward 220+; break below 190–180 could test 
170–180.
- Walls are approximate, derived from OI/volume concentrations in the current 
chain expiring 2025-10-31.

Trends, Volatility, Momentum, Trading Patterns for WDC, AMD, SOUN (no new tools)

WDC
- Trends
  - Price has been in a broad range around 129–133.5 recently; earlier swing 
high near 133.5 suggests nearby resistance.
  - No clear breakout yet; trend remains range-bound with mild upside bias if 
133.5 clears.
- Volatility
  - Recent swing high/low: ~117.23 to 133.54; moderate volatility within a 
~16-point range.
- Momentum
  - RSI 66.4 (approaching overbought, but not extreme).
  - MACD 6.68 with positive histogram ~0.62 indicates ongoing bullish momentum, 
not accelerating strongly.
- Trading Patterns / Signals
  - Support around 129; resistance near 133.5; a move above 133.5 could set 
sights toward 140–142.
  - If price breaks below 129, next support around 125–120.

AMD
- Trends
  - Price action recently in the 240–254 area with periodic testing toward 
253–264 highs; current ~$254.84 sits near recent highs.
  - Upward bias intact while holding above key near-term levels; potential to 
push toward 260–264 if momentum persists.
- Volatility
  - Wide intraday swings (low ~224.88, high ~253.39) indicate elevated 
volatility.
- Momentum
  - RSI 68.1 (near overbought) and MACD 20.74 with strong positive momentum; 
histogram ~1.29 supports upside but cooling risk if overbought grows.
- Trading Patterns / Signals
  - Resistance around 253–260 region; break above 260–264 could target new 
highs.
  - Support around 235–240; a pullback toward 225–230 could reestablish basing.

SOUN
- Trends
  - Price around 16–17; recent weakness pulled from intraday high near 20.2–20.5
to 16.0–17.0 area.
  - Current setup suggests a cautious stance with potential for reversal if 
buyers step in near 16–17.
- Volatility
  - Recent high/low 16.56–20.17; notable volatility for a low-priced name.
- Momentum
  - MACD 0.33 with negative histogram (-0.37) and without a solid RSI reading 
(not available); momentum appears mixed to slightly bearish.
- Trading Patterns / Signals
  - Support around 16.0–16.5; resistance around 20.2–21.0.
  - A break above 20.5 could shift bias positive; a break below 16.0 could 
accelerate downside toward 15.0–14.5.

Notes
- These assessments reflect current price levels and previously observed TA 
signals (RSI, MACD, EMAs where available) without new tool calls.
- Use price action and volume confirmation for any directional decisions.

No tool calls needed - analysis based on existing price data and prior TA 
signals for WDC, AMD, SOUN
