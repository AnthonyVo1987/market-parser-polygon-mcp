   while US equities are paused. FX is shown as closed in this snapshot, which

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Short-term price movement                                                    

 • NVDA closed at 178.19, up 0.50 from the prior close of 177.69, which is      
   roughly +0.28% for the session. The intraday range shows strength intraday   
   with a high of 179.77.                                                       

 2 Liquidity and intraday activity                                              

 • Volume of 148.84 million shares indicates robust liquidity for NVDA during   
   the session, with VWAP near 177.05, suggesting the price hovered around the  
   average traded price despite the market being closed now.                    

 3 Contextual takeaway                                                          

 • The stock traded within a broad intraday range (174.93 - 179.77) and finished
   near the upper end of that range relative to the prior close, indicating     
   modest positive momentum within the session. Market status is closed at the  
   moment, so current action will resume at the next open.
