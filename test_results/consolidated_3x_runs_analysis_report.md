2. **GME closing price today** - 100% compliance, fastest average
3. **Current Market Status** - 100% compliance, stable performance

#### Challenging Tests (Occasional Over 60s)

1. **SPY Technical Analysis** - 66.7% compliance (2/3 runs under 60s)
2. **Single Stock Snapshot NVDA** - 66.7% compliance (2/3 runs under 60s)
3. **Full Market Snapshot: SPY, QQQ, IWM** - 66.7% compliance (2/3 runs under 60s)

#### Performance Improvement Over Time

- **Run 1:** 6/7 tests under 60s (85.7%)
- **Run 2:** 5/7 tests under 60s (71.4%)
- **Run 3:** 7/7 tests under 60s (100%)

**Note:** Run 3 showed the best overall performance with all tests completing under the 60-second target.

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **100% Reliability:** All tests passed successfully across all runs
2. **Consistent Model Usage:** All tests used gpt-5-nano model
3. **Stable Core Functions:** Market status, closing prices, and support/resistance consistently perform well
4. **Improvement Trend:** Performance improved from Run 1 to Run 3

### Areas for Optimization

1. **Technical Analysis Variability:** SPY Technical Analysis shows high variance (24.25s std dev)
2. **Snapshot Performance:** Single Stock Snapshot occasionally exceeds 60s target
3. **Market Snapshot Consistency:** Full Market Snapshot performance varies significantly

### Recommendations

1. **Monitor Technical Analysis:** Investigate why SPY Technical Analysis has high response time variance
2. **Optimize Snapshot Queries:** Review Single Stock Snapshot prompt for potential optimization
3. **Cache Strategy:** Consider implementing caching for frequently requested data
4. **Load Balancing:** Monitor if response times correlate with system load or API rate limits

## Conclusion

The Market Parser CLI demonstrates excellent reliability with 100% success rate across all test runs. While there are occasional performance variations that exceed the 60-second target, the overall system performance is strong with an 85.7% compliance rate. The improvement trend from Run 1 to Run 3 suggests the system may benefit from warm-up or caching mechanisms.

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **PASS** - System meets reliability requirements with room for performance optimization in specific test cases.
