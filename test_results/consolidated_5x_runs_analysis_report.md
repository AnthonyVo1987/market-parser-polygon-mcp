## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **High Reliability:** 100% success rate for completed tests
2. **Consistent Performance:** All completed tests under 60s target
3. **Core Functionality:** Market status and stock snapshots work reliably
4. **Stable Response Times:** Low variability in response times

### Issues Identified
1. **Timeout Problems:** Tests 4-7 consistently timeout at 120s
2. **Incomplete Coverage:** Only 37.1% of total tests complete
3. **API Reliability:** Some tests fail to respond within timeout window
4. **Resource Constraints:** Possible rate limiting or server issues

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Increase Timeout:** Extend timeout from 120s to 180s for Tests 4-7
2. **Investigate API Issues:** Check Polygon.io API status and rate limits
3. **Add Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanism for failed tests
4. **Monitor Resources:** Check system resources during test execution

#### Long-term Improvements
1. **Optimize Prompts:** Reduce complexity of Tests 4-7 prompts
2. **Implement Caching:** Cache frequently requested data
3. **Add Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of API response times
4. **Load Testing:** Test system under various load conditions

## Overall Assessment

✅ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Core functionality works reliably with excellent performance, but timeout issues prevent complete test coverage.

**Strengths:**
- 100% success rate for completed tests
- All tests under 60s target
- Consistent performance across runs
- Reliable core market data functionality

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Resolve timeout issues for Tests 4-7
- Improve overall completion rate
- Investigate API reliability issues
- Implement better error handling

## Conclusion

The Market Parser CLI demonstrates excellent performance for core functionality (market status, stock snapshots) with 100% success rate and consistent sub-60s response times. However, timeout issues with specific tests (GME, SOUN, support/resistance, technical analysis) prevent complete test coverage and need immediate attention.

The system shows promise but requires optimization to achieve full reliability across all test scenarios.
