 • Key takeaway 1: The equity market is fully closed with no regular or         
   after-hours trading on major U.S. exchanges, suggesting no new intraday price
   discovery or settlement activity for stocks today.                           
 • Key takeaway 2: Crypto and FX markets remain active, indicating liquidity and
   price discovery continuing in these venues even when U.S. equities are shut. 
 • Key takeaway 3: The server time confirms status as of early tomorrow in ET,  
   aligning with a non-trading window for equities while select other markets   
   remain operational. Tickers involved for reference: SPX, DJI, IXIC, MSCI,    
   FTSE Russell, MSTAR, MSTARC, CCCY, CGI (and generic FX/Crypto references such
   as BTC-USD, EURUSD).

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Intraday positioning within daily range                                      

 • NVDA is currently near the middle of its daily range (low $173.13, high      
   $180.26) with last price $177.69, indicating neither a strong intraday       
   uptrend nor downtrend at this moment.                                        

 2 Recent activity vs prior session                                             

 • The prior close was $176.97, and today’s print is $177.69, suggesting a      
   modest uptick of about $0.72 on the session, though the snapshot also lists a
   smaller intraday change. The price action suggests a cautious day after a    
   prior-close gap.                                                             

 3 Volume context                                                               

 • Today's volume (191.6M) is notably higher than the previous session’s 143.6M,
   indicating elevated trading activity and possible interest accumulation or   
   distribution in NVDA during this snapshot window. Market status is closed, so
   this reflects pre-close/after-hours activity rather than regular session     
   flow.

 1 Key resistance level: 184.55                                                 

 • Based on the 60-day window highs, this is the notable upper bound. A breakout
   above this level could indicate upside potential beyond this range.          

 2 Key support level: 164.07                                                    

 • Based on the 60-day window lows, this is a meaningful lower bound. A move    
   toward this area could imply renewed buying interest or risk of a continued  
   drop if violated.                                                            

 3 Current positioning and nearby levels                                        

 • Price now: 177.69                                                            
 • About 7.0 below 184.55 and about 13.6 above 164.07                           
 • Nearby reference levels: 180.26 (recent intraday high) acting as short-term  
   overhead resistance before reaching the 184.55 level; 173.13 (recent daily   
   low) as an immediate support close to the current price.

 1 Narrow intraday range with small net move                                    

 • The day displayed a tight session range (~654.41 to 659.41) with a modest    
   close at 658.05, indicating subdued intraday momentum around the 658 area.   

 2 Mixed pre/post-market signals                                                

 • Pre-market reached about 661.25 (briefly above the day’s high), while        
   after-hours traded down to around 657.83, suggesting potential intraday      
   volatility around key levels but no sustained directional conviction into the
   close.                                                                       

 3 Immediate support/resistance levels observed                                 

 • Support: near 654.40 (latest low)                                            
 • Resistance: near 659.40 (latest high) with brief pre-market upside into the  
   661.00–661.25 region                                                         
 • The price action points to a near-term range-bound posture around the 658    
   area, with the 654–661 band acting as a reference for potential reversals or 
   breakouts.
