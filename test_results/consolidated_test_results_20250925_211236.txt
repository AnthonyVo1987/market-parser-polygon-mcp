 1 Key takeaways                                                                

 • NVIDIA (NVDA) finished the prior session with a close of 177.69, after       
   trading within an intraday range of 173.13 to 180.26, and a VWAP of 177.27,  
   on volume of about 191.6 million.                                            
 • Real-time last trade and live quote data are not accessible under the current
   plan, indicating a data access limitation for intraday updates.              
 • The market is currently closed, so these figures reflect the completed       
   session prior to the present time rather than current live movement.         

 2 Contextual notes                                                             

 • The session's open/high/low/close provide a sense of price range and         
   liquidity for NVDA on 2025-09-25, with substantial daily volume, suggesting  
   notable participation during the session.                                    

 3 Quick takeaway                                                               

 • The snapshot shows a modestly constructive close near the session VWAP with a
   wide daily range, but no live intraday signals are available due to data     
   access restrictions.

Market status: Closed Note: Data reflects the snapshot as of today’s session    
close for SPY, QQQ, and IWM.                                                    

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Broad market move (today’s snapshot)                                         

 • All three major ETFs finished lower on the day: SPY (-0.46%), QQQ (-0.49%),  
   IWM (-0.96%). Among the trio, IWM showed the largest intraday decline        
   percentage-wise.                                                             

 2 Activity levels and liquidity                                                

 • SPY had the highest intraday volume at 89.58M, followed by QQQ at 70.90M and 
   IWM at 37.35M, indicating stronger liquidity and participation for the       
   broad-market ETF relative to the small-cap ETF on this session.              

 3 Price action context                                                         

 • Day ranges show modest volatility within the session: SPY traded from 654.41 
   to 659.41; QQQ from 588.50 to 595.12; IWM from 237.55 to 239.99. The close   
   values (SPY 658.05, QQQ 593.53, IWM 239.29) align with the observed negative 
   daily changes, suggesting a broad pullback rather than a sharp rally.

   close.

   total of 345.7M shares.

 • Last Price (as of 2025-09-24 close): 176.97                                  

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 • Key Takeaway 1: The current level is near the pivot PP (177.38). The first   
   upside hurdle is R1 at 179.37; a move beyond R1 could target R2 around       
   181.76.                                                                      
 • Key Takeaway 2: Downside cushions exist at S1 174.99 and S2 173.00. If price 
   weakens further, S3 sits at 166.64 as a deeper support.                      
 • Key Takeaway 3: The price range defined by pivot levels (about 4.38 points   
   between PP and R1, and about 3.99 points to S1) suggests near-term balance   
   with potential directional moves constrained within roughly 174.99 to 179.37 
   unless a breakout occurs.

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Current data access limitation prevents real-time TA for SPY                 

 • With market closed and data access restricted, we cannot determine intraday  
   moves, current price, or recent delta. All standard TA signals (RSI, MACD,   
   moving averages) require price data that isn’t accessible here.              

 2 What would be needed for a robust SPY technical view                         

 • Daily close price (last close), intraday high/low, and volume over the past  
   several weeks to compute:                                                    
    • Moving Averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day)                                
    • RSI (14-day)                                                              
    • MACD (typical settings 12-26-9)                                           
    • Support/resistance levels and trend lines                                 

 3 Expected TA workflow once data is available                                  

 • Retrieve SPY daily closes and highs/lows, then calculate short- and long-term
   trend indicators (e.g., 50-day vs 200-day MA, RSI, MACD) and annotate        
   potential support/resistance zones based on recent price action. This would  
   enable a concise, data-driven technical view of SPY.
