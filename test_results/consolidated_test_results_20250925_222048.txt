 • Market status: Closed (as of 2025-09-25 22:20:51 local time)                 
 • Primary US exchanges: NYSE closed, NASDAQ closed                             
 • After-hours trading: Not active                                              
 • FX market: Open                                                              
 • Crypto market: Open                                                          
 • Indices snapshot (US equities): S&P 500 closed, Dow Jones closed, Nasdaq     
   Composite closed                                                             
 • Last traded prices (SPY, QQQ, DIA): N/A (data access not authorized on       
   current plan)                                                                
 • Notes: Real-time last-trade data requires a higher-tier subscription         

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 •  1 Current state of the market                                               
    • All primary US equity venues are closed. This means no new intraday price 
      formation for SPY/QQQ/DIA until the next session opens.                   
 •  2 Non-equity markets status                                                 
    • FX and crypto markets remain open, offering liquidity and price discovery 
      outside US equities. This can influence risk sentiment and cross-asset    
      correlations even when stocks are dark.                                   
 •  3 Data accessibility context                                                
    • Real-time last-trade data for major equity ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ, DIA) is  
      not accessible under the current plan, limiting precise intraday technical
      readouts (e.g., current price, intraday range) at this moment. This       
      constrains the ability to quantify near-term momentum from market open to 
      close. If needed, a plan upgrade or alternative data feeds could enable   
      those datapoints.

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Recent daily snapshot context                                                

 • The prior-day candle opened at 179.77, reached a high of 179.78, dipped to   
   175.40, and closed at 176.97 on 2025-09-24 with substantial volume (143.56M).
   This indicates a wide intraday range and strong trading activity for the     
   session.                                                                     

 2 After-hours and pre-market signals                                           

 • After-hours traded at 176.52 and pre-market at 179.40, suggesting after-hours
   weakness relative to the pre-market session and potential re-pricing when the
   regular session resumes. The gap between pre-market and after-hours implies  
   differing sentiment or information flow across sessions.                     

 3 Scale and accessibility notes                                                

 • NVDA’s reported market cap is around $4.31T, highlighting its immense size   
   within the tech and AI GPU space. Note that real-time last trade and live    
   quote data are restricted on this plan, which can limit the immediacy of     
   intraday decision-making. The available OHLC data provides a solid           
   completed-session view, but live price/quote granularity is not accessible   
   here.

 •  1 Key levels context: Pivot around 177.38 sits between yesterday’s high and 
      close, with resistance near 179.37 and support near 174.99. These levels  
      mark the near-term battlegrounds for NVDA based on yesterday’s range.     
 •  2 Momentum indicators from yesterday: The intraday range of 4.38 and the    
      close at 176.97 (below pivot) suggest the price finished the day closer to
      the lower side of the range, potentially signaling more downside pressure 
      relative to pivot if similar dynamics repeat.                             
 •  3 Near-term directional cues: Pre-market price at 179.40 touches R1 level,  
      and after-hours trading around 176.52 sits near the lower end of          
      yesterday’s range. If price continues to trade around or above R1,        
      resistance near 181.76 could come into play; if it moves lower, support   
      near 174.99 and 172.00 become reference points.

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Intraday range vs close                                                      

 • The prior session saw SPY trade within a 5.00-point range (654.41 to 659.41) 
   around a close of 658.05, yielding roughly a 0.76% intraday spread from low  
   to high.                                                                     

 2 Price relative to VWAP                                                       

 • Close at 658.05 sits about 0.48 above the session VWAP (657.57), indicating a
   neutral-to-lightly-bullish bias relative to the average price of the day,    
   though no intraday action is available due to market closure.                

 3 Key levels to watch (next session)                                           

 • Support: 654.41                                                              
 • Resistance: 659.41                                                           
 • If the next open moves decisively beyond these levels, it would imply a      
   directional shift relative to the previous session’s range and VWAP          
   reference.
