 • Description: Nvidia is a leading developer of graphics processing units      
   (GPUs) with strong AI compute platforms (CUDA), expanding data center        
   networking, and AI model deployment capabilities.                            

B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 NVDA remains a dominant AI compute player with massive scale                 

 • Market Cap ≈ $4.326 trillion indicates one of the largest public tech        
   companies, reflecting leadership in GPUs, AI workloads, and data center      
   solutions.                                                                   
 • Large workforce (about 36k) supported by extensive product ecosystem (GPUs,  
   software platform CUDA, data center networking).                             

 2 Real-time price data access is currently unavailable in this session         

 • Unable to display last price, bid, ask, or intraday movement due to access   
   restrictions.                                                                
 • For a complete snapshot, intraday metrics (last price, daily change, volume, 
   spread) would be essential.                                                  

 3 Fundamental snapshot is robust, but intraday context is missing              

 • Listing since 1999-01-22 confirms long-standing market presence.             
 • 52-week high/low and daily range are not available here, limiting assessment 
   of recent volatility.                                                        
 • Company profile suggests strong secular tailwinds from AI adoption and       
   hyperscale compute demand, but intraday momentum cannot be inferred from the 
   current data.
