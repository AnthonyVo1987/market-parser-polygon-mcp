B. DETAILED ANALYSIS                                                            

 1 Current status takeaway                                                      

 • The market is clearly in a closed state across major equity venues (NYSE,    
   NASDAQ), with end-of-day conditions in effect and no after-hours activity    
   reported.                                                                    

 2 Data access note                                                             

 • Real-time last-trade prices for SPY and QQQ are not accessible under the     
   current plan, so price-level context for these assets cannot be provided     
   here. Upgrading would enable retrieval of live price data.                   

 3 Time/context alignment                                                       

 • Server timestamp shows ET 01:01:40 on 2025-09-27, which may differ from the  
   local context time (2025-09-26 22:01). Rely on the server time for status    
   checks and ensure alignment when interpreting after-hours or cross-date      
   signals.
