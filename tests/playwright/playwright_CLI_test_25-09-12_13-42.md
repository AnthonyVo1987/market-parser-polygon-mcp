## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Configuration Validation Issues (High Priority)

**Problem:** Polling interval configuration mismatch across all tests  
**Expected:** 30000ms (30-second intervals)  
**Actual:** 100ms (Playwright internal polling)  
**Impact:** Test configuration validation failures but functional tests pass  
**Recommendation:** Update test configuration to match Playwright's internal polling mechanics

**Affected Tests:** B001, B002, B003, B004, B005, B007 (all major tests)

### 2. Ticker Input Preservation Issues (High Priority)

**Problem:** Button template system not preserving user ticker input  
**Expected Behavior:** User enters NVDA/GME → Analysis shows NVDA/GME  
**Actual Behavior:** User enters NVDA/GME → Analysis shows AAPL (default)  
**Impact:** Button functionality works but ticker specificity fails  
**Recommendation:** Debug ticker variable passing through button template system

**Affected Tests:** B007, B009, B010 (button tests requiring specific tickers)

### 3. Multi-Ticker Processing Limitations (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** Multi-ticker queries not processing all requested tickers  
**Expected:** 4 tickers (NVDA, SPY, QQQ, IWM)  
**Actual:** 2 tickers detected in response  
**Impact:** Complex multi-ticker analysis incomplete  
**Recommendation:** Optimize multi-ticker processing for complete coverage

**Affected Tests:** B005 (Multi-Ticker Analysis)

### 4. Response Format Standardization (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** Missing 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS section in response formatting  
**Expected:** Consistent structured output with KEY TAKEAWAYS  
**Actual:** Financial content present but formatting inconsistent  
**Impact:** Response validation failures despite functional content delivery  
**Recommendation:** Standardize response formatting across all analysis types

**Affected Tests:** B001, B002, B003, B004 (Market/Ticker tests)
