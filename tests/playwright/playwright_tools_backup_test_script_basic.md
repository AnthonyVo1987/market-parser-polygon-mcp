---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY:** Read and understand these requirements before proceeding:

1. **Follow Instructions VERBATIM** - Do not deviate from exact tool calls and parameters
2. **Use EXACT Tool Names** - Only use `mcp_playwright-backup_*` tools specified here
3. **Set EXPLICIT Timeouts** - Always use proper timeout parameters for response detection
4. **Verify Prerequisites** - ALWAYS check servers are running before testing
5. **Validate First-Try Success** - Document must enable success without external research
6. **ALWAYS Start Fresh** - Close browser, kill servers, restart everything - Never assume previous state
7. **Proper Input Field Identification** - Take screenshot first, use HTML inspection, use `#main-input` (not generic selectors)
8. **Patient Polling (120-second MAX)** - Wait 30 seconds between checks, MAXIMUM 4 polls = 120 seconds total, Don't report failure until 120 seconds elapsed
9. **Look for Actual Response Content** - Not just loading states, check for structured format and response metadata

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** This document supersedes ALL other testing documentation. If conflicts exist, follow THIS document.

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Wrong Input Selector** - Always inspect HTML first
2. **False Failure Reporting** - Wait for actual response, not loading states
3. **Insufficient Polling** - 30-second intervals, **MAX 120 seconds total**
4. **Missing Environment Reset** - Always start completely fresh
5. **Incomplete Validation** - Check all success criteria, not just response presence
6. **Exceeding Timeout** - **Never wait longer than 120 seconds per AI response**
7. **Context Loss** - Re-read script before each test execution
8. **Resume vs Start Fresh** - Always start over, never try to resume
9. **Wrong Tool Names** - Use exact `mcp_playwright-backup_*` tool names
10. **Overcomplication** - Follow the script exactly, don't add unnecessary steps

**Verification Step:**
If any of these tools are unavailable, STOP and request tool access before proceeding.

### 1.2 Server Requirements

**REQUIRED Servers Running:**

- **Backend FastAPI:** <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (application backend)
- **Frontend React:** <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (or auto-detected port 3001, 3002, etc.)

**Server Verification Procedure:**

```bash
1. Backend Health Check:
   - Expected response: {"status": "healthy"} from http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
   
2. Frontend Accessibility Check:  
   - Expected response: React application loads from http://127.0.0.1:3000
   - Note: Vite may auto-select ports 3001, 3002 if 3000 occupied
```

**CRITICAL:** If servers are not running, execute: `./start-app.sh` (or `npm run start:app` as alternative). The script will automatically open the application in your browser after confirming both servers are running.

### 1.3 Environment Verification

**Pre-Test Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] All required Playwright backup tools respond correctly
- [ ] Backend server returns healthy status
- [ ] Frontend server loads React application

## Section 4: Response Detection & Polling Implementation

### 4.1 Manual Polling Methodology

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** Playwright backup tools require manual polling for response detection.

**Polling Implementation Steps:**

1. Submit message using `mcp_playwright-backup_playwright_press_key`
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Check response using `mcp_playwright-backup_playwright_get_visible_text`
4. Analyze response content for detection patterns
5. If response found, proceed to validation
6. If no response, repeat steps 2-4 (maximum 24 times = 120 seconds)

**Detection Patterns to Look For:**

- "KEY TAKEAWAYS" - Primary detection pattern
- "DETAILED ANALYSIS" - Secondary detection pattern
- "DISCLAIMER" - Tertiary detection pattern
- Financial data indicators (price, volume, market data)
- Emoji indicators (📈, 📉, 📊)

### 4.2 Response Content Validation

**Required Validation Checks:**

1. **Response Detection:** Verify polling successfully detected response
2. **Content Quality:** Check for financial data and analysis
3. **Format Compliance:** Verify structured sections (KEY TAKEAWAYS, DETAILED ANALYSIS, DISCLAIMER)
4. **Completeness:** Ensure response addresses original query

**Validation Tool Usage:**

```json
{
  "tool": "mcp_playwright-backup_playwright_evaluate",
  "parameters": {
    "script": "() => { const messages = document.querySelectorAll('.message-content'); const lastMessage = messages[messages.length-1]?.textContent || ''; return { hasStructuredContent: /KEY\\s*TAKEAWAYS|DETAILED\\s*ANALYSIS|DISCLAIMER/i.test(lastMessage), contentLength: lastMessage.length, containsFinancialData: /price|volume|market|trading/i.test(lastMessage) }; }"
  }
}
```

## Section 5: Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Common Tool Parameter Errors

**Error:** "Element not found" or "Selector not found"
**Cause:** Incorrect element selector
**Solution:** Use multiple fallback selectors

```json
"selector": "textarea[placeholder*='message'], .chat-input textarea, input[type='text'], #message-input"
```

**Error:** "Navigation failed" or "Connection refused"
**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. Verify backend: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
2. Verify frontend: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
3. Check for port conflicts or server crashes

**Solution:** Restart servers with `./start-app.sh` or `npm run start:app`

### 5.2 Response Detection Failures

**Error:** "No response detected after 120 seconds"
**Possible Causes:**

1. Server processing issues (check server logs)
2. Incorrect detection patterns
3. UI changes affecting response format
4. Frontend not displaying chat messages properly
5. JavaScript errors preventing message display

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Take screenshot to examine current page state
2. Check console logs for JavaScript errors
3. Test backend directly with curl to verify API functionality
4. Try alternative detection patterns (MARKET, ANALYSIS, DETAILED ANALYSIS)
5. Verify server health and processing status
6. Check if messages are in DOM but not visible
7. Look for different CSS selectors for chat messages

**Backend API Test:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Market Status: PRIORITY FAST REQUEST"}'
```

**Frontend Debugging:**

```javascript
// Check for chat messages in DOM
() => { 
  const allElements = document.querySelectorAll('*'); 
  const chatElements = Array.from(allElements).filter(el => 
    el.textContent && (
      el.textContent.includes('KEY TAKEAWAYS') || 
      el.textContent.includes('Market Status') || 
      el.textContent.includes('SPX')
    )
  ); 
  return { 
    foundElements: chatElements.length, 
    content: chatElements.map(el => el.textContent?.substring(0, 200) || '') 
  }; 
}
```

### 5.3 Frontend Display Issues

**Error:** "Backend responds but frontend doesn't display messages"
**Possible Causes:**

1. JavaScript errors preventing message rendering
2. CSS issues hiding chat messages
3. React state management problems
4. WebSocket/API connection issues

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Check console logs for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API calls are being made from frontend
3. Check if messages are in DOM but hidden by CSS
4. Test with different browser or incognito mode
5. Check network tab for failed requests

**Debugging Commands:**

```javascript
// Check for JavaScript errors
() => { 
  const errors = window.console._logs?.filter(log => log.level === 'error') || []; 
  return { errorCount: errors.length, errors: errors.map(e => e.message) }; 
}

// Check for chat container elements
() => { 
  const chatContainers = document.querySelectorAll('[class*="chat"], [class*="message"], [class*="conversation"]'); 
  return { containerCount: chatContainers.length, containers: Array.from(chatContainers).map(c => c.className) }; 
}
```

### 5.4 Browser State Issues

**Error:** "Browser not responding" or "Page unresponsive"
**Solution:** Refresh browser state

```json
{
  "tool": "mcp_playwright-backup_playwright_navigate",
  "parameters": {
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
  }
}
```
